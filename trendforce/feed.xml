     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Shortly after CEO Jensen Huang met with Samsung Electronics Chairman Jay Y. Lee and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung over fried chicken and beer, NVIDIA announced a major collaboration with the South Korean government and tech industry, led by Samsung.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-%ec%97%94%eb%b9%84%eb%94%94%ec%95%84%ec%99%80-%ed%95%a8%ea%bb%98-%ec%97%85%ea%b3%84-%ec%b5%9c%ea%b3%a0-%ec%88%98%ec%a4%80-%eb%b0%98%eb%8f%84%ec%b2%b4&quot;&gt;
    Samsung
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , it has formed a strategic partnership with NVIDIA to establish an “AI Megafactory” designed to supercharge Samsung’s semiconductor production. The new facility will be equipped with more than 50,000 of NVIDIA’s most advanced GPUs, embedding AI throughout every stage of chip manufacturing.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, the deal also opens a major business opportunity for the South Korean memory giant. Alongside the factory project, Samsung will supply NVIDIA with its latest memory solutions and foundry services—including HBM3e, HBM4, GDDR7, and SOCAMM2.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20251031145139&quot;&gt;
    ZDNet
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  highlights that Samsung and NVIDIA have maintained a partnership spanning more than 25 years, starting with graphics DRAM supply in the late 1990s. Their new AI factory project now reportedly marks the evolution of that long-standing collaboration into a full-fledged AI semiconductor alliance.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Samsung: All-in on HBM4
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In a notable shift from its traditionally low-key approach, Samsung openly revealed that it is in close talks with NVIDIA to supply HBM4—on top of the products it already provides. The company plans to proactively invest in facilities to seamlessly meet rapidly increasing customer demand for HBM4, as per its press release.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Samsung said its HBM4 combines a 4nm logic base with sixth-generation 10nm-class (1c) DRAM, achieving speeds of over 11Gbps—surpassing both the JEDEC standard of 8Gbps and customer expectations.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In addition, Samsung noted that it is currently supplying HBM3e to all global clients, and has completed sample shipments of HBM4 to all customers who requested samples, and is preparing for mass production shipments according to customer schedules.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   SK hynix Also Joins Force
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, Samsung’s archrival, SK hynix, announced similar form of cooperation. As
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/sk-group-ai-factory&quot;&gt;
    NVIDIA
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  stated in its press release, the two parties are deepening their collaboration to advance SK hynix’s HBM and next-generation memory solutions for GPUs, chip manufacturing, and telecommunications, which centers on a massive AI factory featuring over 50,000 NVIDIA GPUs, with the first phase slated for completion by late 2027.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Once operational, the facility is expected to become one of Korea’s largest AI factories, supporting SK subsidiaries—including SK hynix and SK Telecom—as well as external organizations via a GPU-as-a-service model, as per the announcement.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   260K NVIDIA GPUs to be Supplied Across Korea
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The partnerships with Samsung and SK hynix are just the beginning. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20251031131552&quot;&gt;
    ZDNet
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , NVIDIA plans to supply 260,000 GPUs to the Korean government and local companies, expanding collaboration across AI infrastructure, semiconductors, robotics, telecommunications, and data centers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Currently, about 65,000 NVIDIA Hopper GPUs are deployed among domestic firms and institutions in Korea, the report suggests. Under the new plan, NVIDIA will reportedly deliver a total of 260,000 Blackwell GPUs: up to 5,000 each to the Korean government, Samsung Electronics, SK Group, and Hyundai Motor Group, and 60,000 units to Naver Cloud.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  ZDNet, citing a NVIDIA official, notes that the Blackwell GPUs supplied in Korea will include both GB200 servers and RTX Pro 6000 workstations. Once fully deployed, the company’s GPU footprint in the country is expected to nearly quintuple, rising from 65,000 to 320,000 units, the report adds.

    Yahoo! Finance
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  transcripts, CEO Andy Jassy said Trainium2 adoption remains strong, and Trainium3 is set to preview by year-end, with full-scale production ramping early 2026.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Jassy reportedly highlighted that Trainium2 is fully subscribed, now a multi-billion-dollar business growing 150% quarter-over-quarter. As per Yahoo! Finance, he said Trainium2 currently serves a small group of very large customers. Strong price-performance—30–40% better than alternatives—combined with growing demand for AI inference workloads, is driving wider interest.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, Trainium is expected expand with Trainium3 to accommodate both large and mid-sized clients, which are already showing significant traction in the next-generation chip, he added.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to Amazon, Project Rainier, the company’s massive AI compute cluster across multiple U.S. data centers, is now online with nearly 500,000 Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is already running its flagship AI model, Claude, on the system, which is expected to scale to over 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, CEO Andy Jassy reportedly pointed out that throughout Amazon’s history, AWS has never relied on a single vendor to dominate any major technology component or meet all customer needs. Thus, the company will maintain a long-standing partnership with NVIDIA, purchasing significant volumes of their chips without constraints and expecting to continue doing so in the future, according to Yahoo! Finance.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251013-12741.html&quot;&gt;
   TrendForce
  &lt;/a&gt;
  notes that AWS is prioritizing its Trainium v2 chips, with a liquid-cooled rack version expected by late 2025. The Trainium v3, developed jointly with Alchip and Marvell, is planned for mass production in early 2026. AWS’s ASIC shipments are anticipated to more than double in 2025, marking the fastest growth among major CSPs, with a further approximate 20% increase in 2026, TrendForce projects.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Soaring Capex
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, as Reuters reports, Amazon’s cloud revenue grew at its fastest pace in nearly three years, helping the company forecast quarterly sales above estimates.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company also projected higher capital spending next year. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-largely-below-estimates-2025-10-30/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said full-year capital expenditures are expected to reach around $125 billion, with higher spending next year, though he did not provide further details. Through the first three quarters, the company had already spent $89.9 billion, largely on AI-related projects, the report notes.
 &lt;/p&gt;

  reports that Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $33 billion in third-quarter revenue, above the $32.42 billion projected by analysts, reflecting 18.1% year-over-year growth. Operating income rose 9% to $11.4 billion, accounting for roughly two-thirds of Amazon’s total operating profit and exceeding estimates, the report suggests.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As the leading global cloud infrastructure provider, AWS faces growing competition from Google and Microsoft. Google’s cloud revenue climbed 34%, while Microsoft Azure posted 40% growth in the same period, according to CNBC.

 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Disruptions at Nexperia continue to heighten concerns over a potential auto chip shortage, putting additional pressure on global automakers. In response, the EU is stepping in. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-tech-chief-virkkunen-meet-chipmaker-nexperia-friday-2025-10-30/&quot;&gt;

  Virkkunen announced the planned meeting on

  &lt;/span&gt;
  , saying the case provides “important lessons being drawn for the EU’s #ChipsAct 2.0,” which is expected to launch in early 2026. Earlier on Thursday, she also held virtual meetings with the chief executives of Infineon, STMicroelectronics, NXP, and Acea, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   How the US-China Summit Might Shape Wingtech’s Position
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p data-end=&quot;528&quot; data-start=&quot;156&quot;&gt;
  The standoff between Nexperia and the Dutch government may be shifting following the recent U.S.-China meeting. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3330953/netherlands-faces-pressure-surrender-control-nexperia-after-xi-trump-summit&quot;&gt;
    South China Morning Post
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , China’s Ministry of Commerce said Washington would temporarily suspend its so-called 50 percent subsidiary rule, a policy that is believed to have prompted the Dutch government to tighten its grip on Nexperia.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p data-end=&quot;873&quot; data-start=&quot;530&quot;&gt;
  As the South China Morning Post explains, the rule, introduced in late September, expanded U.S. export controls to include any company at least 50 percent owned by entities on Washington’s trade blacklist. With the rule now on hold, the Dutch government may find it harder to justify maintaining its seizure of the Chinese-owned chipmaker, the report indicates.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Wingtech’s Push to Reinstate Ousted CEO Zhang Amid Alleged China Shift
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, Wingtech, the parent company of Nexperia, has outlined conditions for resuming the chipmaker’s global supply.
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-30/nexperia-s-chinese-owner-demands-reinstatement-of-ousted-ceo?srnd=phx-economics-v2&quot;&gt;
    Bloomberg
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  notes that Wingtech is demanding the reinstatement of former CEO Zhang Xuezheng as part of any deal to restart Nexperia’s exports from China, a stance that significantly complicates efforts to resolve the standoff.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  New details have emerged about the circumstances reportedly surrounding Zhang’s removal. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/dutch-government-took-control-nexperia-over-fears-it-was-being-gutted-sources-2025-10-27/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , sources say the Dutch government’s decision to seize control of Nexperia in September stemmed from concerns that Zhang had begun shifting the company’s European operations and production to China.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Reuters further notes, citing sources, that Zhang, who is also the founder of Nexperia’s Chinese parent company Wingtech, had planned to lay off 40% of staff in Europe and close a research and development facility in Munich. Before being suspended as CEO by a Dutch court, Zhang had transferred confidential information from Nexperia’s Manchester plant in the U.K. to a Wingtech facility in China, including chip designs and equipment settings, according to Reuters, citing sources.

  After refreshing its AI chip roadmap with the next-gen Crescent Island data center GPU following Gaudi, Intel is reportedly eyeing its next move in AI.
  &lt;span&gt;

    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  report that the chipmaker in early talks to acquire AI chip startup SambaNova Systems, where CEO Lip-Bu Tan has served as executive chairman since May 2024.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, SambaNova, a designer of custom AI chips, has long-standing ties to Team Blue. Bloomberg reports that while Lip-Bu Tan serves as executive chairman, his venture firm Walden International was one of SambaNova’s founding investors, leading a $56 million Series A in 2018. SoftBank Group later headed a $676 million round in 2021, valuing the startup at $5 billion, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, any transaction would likely value SambaNova below the $5 billion it achieved in the 2021 funding round, according to Bloomberg.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The chipmaker has reportedly been discussing possible deal terms with SambaNova, which has been working with bankers to gauge interest from potential buyers. As Reuters notes, a takeover of SambaNova would mark a shift in Intel’s acquisition strategy from April, when CFO David Zinsner said the company had no plans for major deals in the near term.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   More about SambaNova
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  SambaNova was founded in 2017 in Palo Alto, California, and counts some of the tech industry’s biggest names among its investors, including Intel Capital, Micron’s Intelligence Accelerated, SK Telecom, Samsung Catalyst Fund, and BlackRock, according to the company’s
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://sambanova.ai/company/about&quot;&gt;
    website
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It is interesting to note that while NVIDIA tightened its dominance in chips used for training large AI models, SambaNova pivoted toward the inference market—building systems optimized to run already-trained models, Bloomberg suggests.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eetimes.com/sambanova-lays-off-15-of-workforce-to-refocus-on-inference/&quot;&gt;
    EE Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , SambaNova has laid off 77 employees, roughly 15% of its 500-strong workforce, as it pivots its business strategy. A company spokesperson told EE Times that the cuts come as SambaNova shifts away from training workloads toward AI cloud services.

  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p data-end=&quot;1203&quot; data-start=&quot;834&quot;&gt;
  While Toshiba did not disclose the reason for its decision, Nikkei, citing sources, indicates that the agreement was ended early out of caution toward deeper cooperation beyond procurement. The company is believed to have reconsidered the partnership from the standpoint of economic security and concerns over potential technology and talent outflow, the report adds, citing sources.

   Wolfspeed’s Recovery Efforts Tempered by Weak Demand
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p data-end=&quot;1883&quot; data-start=&quot;1557&quot;&gt;
  While Toshiba’s breakup with SICC underscores shifting dynamics in Asia, U.S. SiC supplier Wolfspeed is facing challenges of its own. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/wolfspeed-posts-weaker-profit-first-quarter-after-exiting-bankruptcy-2025-10-29/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , Wolfspeed reported lower first-quarter profit for fiscal 2026, underscoring the challenges the U.S. chipmaker faces as it emerges from bankruptcy and struggles with weak demand.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p data-end=&quot;2231&quot; data-start=&quot;1885&quot;&gt;
  As Reuters notes, the company had bet heavily on silicon carbide materials for long-term growth, but those gains have been slower to emerge as automakers curb production and delay chip orders. The report adds that Wolfspeed sees near-term headwinds while expanding into new growth areas such as AI data centers, aerospace, and energy storage.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p data-end=&quot;2670&quot; data-start=&quot;2233&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://s29.q4cdn.com/278875087/files/doc_earnings/2026/q1/earnings-result/Wolfspeed_Q1_2026_Earnings_Release.pdf&quot;&gt;
    Wolfspeed
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  announced its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, reporting consolidated revenue of approximately $197 million, compared with $195 million a year earlier. The company said it expects a sequential decline in revenue for the second quarter, forecasting between $150 million and $190 million. In line with broader industry trends, Wolfspeed noted ongoing market softness that it expects to persist through fiscal 2026.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p data-end=&quot;2670&quot; data-start=&quot;2233&quot;&gt;
  In 2024, Wolfspeed led the global SiC substrate market with a 34% share, but Chinese rivals TankeBlue and SICC are catching up, each holding 17%, according to

     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The disruptions at Nexperia have underscored China’s leverage in global chip supply. Now, Beijing is accelerating efforts to expand its domestic auto chip ecosystem. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3330764/chinese-state-owned-firms-launch-car-chip-testing-platform-shenzhen-amid-nexperia-row?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article&quot;&gt;
    South China Morning Post
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , China has opened a state-level testing platform for automotive chips in Shenzhen. The report notes that the facility represents the country’s first state-backed infrastructure for verifying car-chip standards and supports China’s broader pursuit of technological self-sufficiency.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The platform was jointly launched by two state-owned enterprises — China Reform Holdings, an investment vehicle focused on sectors tied to national security and the economy, and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center, a leading industry research institute, as the report indicates.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As the report highlights, citing the firms’ joint announcement, the platform is equipped with more than 80 sets of testing instruments and 13 laboratories specializing in areas such as automotive-grade environmental and reliability testing, information security, and failure analysis.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The platform’s one-stop layout, as noted by Chinese media outlet
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mydrivers.com/1/1083/1083228.htm&quot;&gt;
    Mydrivers
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , effectively addresses the fragmentation of China’s automotive chip verification resources, where different categories previously required testing by multiple institutions, significantly shortening the validation cycle.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Citing industry experts, Mydrivers states that the platform is a state-level pilot verification facility covering nine major and 81 subcategories of automotive chips. It serves as a public testing platform encompassing all application scenarios, including intelligent driving, smart cockpit, security, and power chips. The platform is expected to help accelerate the localization of high-end automotive chips, according to South China Morning Post, citing Shenzhen municipal authorities.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the long run, the platform’s development carries broader strategic significance. According to Mydrivers, China plans to use it to establish unified evaluation methods and a standardized verification framework for automotive-grade chips, laying the foundation for a national standards system. The initiative is expected to improve the quality of domestic automotive chips and strengthen China’s influence in setting global standards, the report highlights.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Nexperia Disruption Ripples Across Global Auto Sector
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While China is moving to strengthen its auto chip sector, the global auto industry is facing renewed strain. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/nissan-mercedes-sound-alarm-over-chip-supply-crisis-2025-10-29/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , automakers are scrambling to secure semiconductor supplies as a worsening shortage linked to Dutch firm Nexperia threatens production worldwide. The report, citing sources, notes that Nissan has chips only until the first week of November — just days away — while Honda has suspended operations at a plant in Mexico and begun adjusting output in the U.S..

     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As hyperscalers kick off their latest earnings reports today, capex is taking center stage amid AI bubble concerns. But for now, those worries may be on hold, as Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft all plan to ramp up spending significantly,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/cnbc-daily-open-capex-is-the-number-to-look-at-amid-big-tech-earnings.html&quot;&gt;
    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Among them, Alphabet—Google’s parent—stands out for its ambition.
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/alphabet-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-strong-ad-cloud-demand-2025-10-29/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports the company has raised its 2025 capex forecast to $91–$93 billion, driven by strong AI demand. This marks the third upward revision for 2025, following $75 billion in February and $85 billion in July, after spending $52.5 billion in 2024, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, citing CFO Anat Ashkenazi, CNBC suggests that Alphabet’s 2026 could see “a significant increase” as well.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meta, as per CNBC, also boosted the low end of its annual capex guidance to $70 billion from $66 billion, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg noting that “making a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be profitable.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, Microsoft, racing to expand AI-powered data centers, spent a staggering $34.9 billion in the quarter ending Sept. 30—a 74% jump from a year ago and well above the $30 billion estimate,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/microsoft-quarterly-earnings.html&quot;&gt;
    The New York Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  and CNBC report. CFO Amy Hood added that fiscal 2026 capex is expected to grow even faster than 2025, according to CNBC.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Amazon, set to release its earnings on October 30, reported $31.4 billion in capital expenditures in Q2, calling it “reasonably representative” of spending for the rest of the year,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/amazon-earnings-ai-aws-tariffs.html&quot;&gt;
    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reported. Combined with $24 billion in Q1, total capex could reach $118 billion in 2025, exceeding the prior $100 billion forecast, as per CNBC.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But beneath the bold investment figures, risks are quietly building for these cloud giants. Here’s a closer look.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Meta: One-Time Tax Hit and Reality Labs Losses in Spotlight
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/29/meta-earnings-report&quot;&gt;
    The Guardian
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  points out, Meta posted mixed Q3 2025 results, reporting record quarterly revenue but a massive tax hit that crushed earnings per share. The company earned $51.24 billion in revenue, reportedly surpassing both Wall Street and its own forecasts. However, EPS came in at $1.05, far below the expected $6.70.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/metas-profit-hit-by-16-billion-one-time-tax-charge-2025-10-29/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  explains that Meta took a nearly $16 billion one-time hit in Q3 tied to U.S. President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. Meta said that excluding this charge, EPS would have risen by $15.93 billion to reach $18 billion, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, Meta’s Reality Labs continues to drag on profits.
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/metas-reality-labs-posts-4point4-billion-loss-in-third-quarter.html&quot;&gt;
    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports the division has accumulated over $70 billion in losses since late 2020, underscoring the high cost of building VR, AR, and other consumer hardware.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In Q3, Reality Labs posted an operating loss of $4.4 billion on $470 million in sales. CFO Susan Li told analysts that Q4 revenue is expected to fall short of last year, partly because no new VR headset launched in 2025, CNBC notes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, with Meta raising the low end of its annual capex guidance to $70 billion, Reuters notes that employee compensation will be the second-largest cost, driven by salaries for staff hired in 2025, particularly in AI roles.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Microsoft: OpenAI Investment Remains Murky and Unclear
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Microsoft posted $77.7 billion in sales, up 18% year-over-year, with $27.7 billion in profits, a 12% increase. As The New York Times highlights, growth was mainly driven by Azure and its partnership with AI startup OpenAI.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Nonetheless,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/microsofts-openai-math-is-still-a-black-box&quot;&gt;
    Tom’s Hardware
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  points out that though Microsoft’s AI strategy is closely linked to OpenAI, the financial details remain opaque. In its latest annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, Microsoft listed $4.7 billion under “other, net” expenses without providing a detailed breakdown.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The report, citing
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-needs-to-open-up-more-about-its-openai-dealings-59102de8?&quot;&gt;
    The Wall Street Journal
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , notes that most of this amount comes from “net recognized losses on equity method investments.” While it’s widely understood that OpenAI falls into this category, the filing never mentions OpenAI by name and does not classify it as a related party, Tom’s Hardware suggests.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;

  , Microsoft said at its latest earnings call that the company has committed a total investment of $13 billion in OpenAI. As of the end of September, $11.6 billion has already been funded. The investment impacted Microsoft’s Q1 profit by $3.086 billion, the report adds.

   Alphabet: Strong Cloud Growth and Big AI Deals
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Among the hyperscalers, Alphabet’s momentum seems to be the most clear.
  &lt;span&gt;

    Bloomberg
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports that the company reported third-quarter sales of $87.5 billion, topping the $85.1 billion analysts expected, boosted by its cloud unit as AI startups turn to Google for computing power. Net income came in at $2.87 per share, above Wall Street’s $2.26 estimate, the report suggests.
 &lt;/p&gt;

    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports that Google Cloud is gaining momentum, with 32% year-over-year growth and a backlog of $155 billion. CEO Sundar Pichai and CFO Anat Ashkenazi noted that the company has secured more $1 billion deals in the past nine months than it did in the previous two years combined, as per the report.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to CNBC, Alphabet’s recent highlights include a $10 billion six-year cloud contract with Meta in August, and a deal with Anthropic giving the AI company access to up to 1 million of Google’s custom TPUs, valued at tens of billions of dollars.

     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Trump’s tariff push is jolting the semiconductor world, heightening uncertainty over global trade and competition. South Korea, deeply embedded in the global chip ecosystem, could be among the most affected by Washington’s next move. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chosun.com/international/us/2025/10/30/WA2HRMJPEFA4TNCL7TTKJ27F7Y/&quot;&gt;
    Chosun Ilbo
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , following the summit on the 29th between President Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung — where the two leaders reached an agreement on tariff negotiations — U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later stated that “semiconductors are not part of this deal.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Lutnick’s remarks, however, stand in contrast to the South Korean government’s statement that the U.S. had agreed to set semiconductor tariffs “at levels no less favorable than those applied to Taiwan, a key competitor,” the report notes. As
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20251029202236&quot;&gt;
    ZDNet
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  points out, the initial understanding was expected to significantly ease uncertainty surrounding exports from major Korean chipmakers — including Samsung Electronics and SK hynix — to the U.S. market.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Under the new agreement reached at the summit, the two countries will maintain reciprocal tariffs at 15% and lower tariffs on automobiles and auto parts to the same level. As ZDNet adds, the U.S. investment package includes a $200 billion cash investment and an additional $150 billion directed toward the shipbuilding industry.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The U.S. Department of Commerce is currently conducting investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which authorizes the president to impose tariffs on imports deemed a threat to national security. As The Chosun Ilbo notes, Trump underscored the importance of strengthening domestic semiconductor production in August, saying that the U.S. “could impose tariffs of up to 100%.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Semiconductors have long been one of South Korea’s key export items to the U.S. Citing data from the Korea International Trade Association, ZDNet notes that South Korea’s semiconductor exports to the U.S. totaled $10.6 billion last year, representing 7.5% of its overall chip exports.

     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Riding the wave of the memory supercycle, Samsung joined SK hynix in posting stellar third-quarter results. Following SK hynix’s record-breaking profit, Samsung reported a 32% year-on-year surge in operating profit in the third quarter — its strongest performance in over three years, according to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-electronics-q3-profit-jumps-32-conventional-chip-boom-2025-10-30/&quot;&gt;

    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports that Samsung’s operating profit more than doubled from the previous quarter, fueled by a rebound in its chip business. The surge could be attributed to higher product prices and the absence of one-off inventory costs that weighed on the previous quarter’s results,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20251030091630&quot;&gt;
    ZDNet
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company posted third-quarter revenue of 86.1 trillion won, slightly above the LSEG SmartEstimate of 85.93 trillion won, and operating profit of 12.2 trillion won, beating expectations of 11.25 trillion won, CNBC suggests. Overall, revenue climbed 8.9% year-on-year, while operating profit surged 32.9%.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Memory Sales Reach All-time High
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Among Samsung’s business units, the semiconductor division stood out, with Reuters noting that it delivered an operating profit of 7 trillion won ($4.92 billion) in the third quarter — an 80% surge from a year earlier.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, according to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-third-quarter-2025-results&quot;&gt;
    Samsung
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , the Device Solutions (DS) Division recorded a 19% QoQ rise in sales, with the Memory Business achieving an all-time quarterly high, driven by strong momentum in HBM3e and server SSDs. ZDNet adds that Samsung’s HBM3e has now entered full-scale mass production for all major customers, while HBM4 samples have been shipped to every client that requested them.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   2nm at Full Swing
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, Samsung’s foundry business is also rebounding, with the company reporting record-high customer orders in the third quarter, driven primarily by advanced node demand. According to Samsung, its first-generation 2nm GAA process has already entered mass production.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Alongside its Exynos 2600, set to power the upcoming Galaxy S26,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202510281433409560104122&quot;&gt;
    The Bell
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports that Samsung is gearing up to mass-produce Tesla’s AI5 and AI6 chips at its Taylor fab in Texas. Notably, in addition to AI6, the report suggests that AI5 will likely be built on Samsung’s cutting-edge 2nm process as well.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Looking ahead to next year, the company aims to increase sales of high-value products, with full-scale commercialization of new processes, particularly in its semiconductor business, expected to drive further momentum.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For memory, Samsung plans to ramp up production of 1c (6th-generation 10nm) DRAM to meet rising demand for HBM4. In foundry, the new Taylor fab in the U.S. will take the lead in mass-producing the cutting-edge 2nm process.

   GlobalFoundries Accelerates Expansion in Germany
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The executive changes came just a day before the company announced its latest investment plans. On October 28,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://gf.com/gf-press-release/globalfoundries-plans-billion-euro-investment-to-expand-chip-manufacturing-in-germany/&quot;&gt;
    GlobalFoundries
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  unveiled a €1.1 billion expansion of its manufacturing facilities in Dresden. The investment will raise production capacity to over one million wafers annually by the end of 2028, positioning the Dresden site as the largest of its kind in Europe, the company said in its press release.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The expansion, called Project SPRINT, is set to receive backing from the German federal government and the State of Saxony under the European Chips Act framework, with EU approval expected later this year, according to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/globalfoundries-to-invest-11-billion-in-dresden-chip-facility-expansion-93CH-4314290&quot;&gt;

    Bloomberg
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  adds that GlobalFoundries CEO Tim Breen said the expansion in Germany is aimed at meeting growing customer demand for semiconductor supply chains independent of China and Taiwan.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Alongside its European expansion,

   &lt;a href=&quot;https://gf.com/gf-press-release/globalfoundries-announces-16b-u-s-investment-to-reshore-essential-chip-manufacturing-and-accelerate-ai-growth/&quot;&gt;
    GlobalFoundries
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  announced in June a $16 billion investment to expand semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging at its New York and Vermont facilities. The company is working with major partners — including Apple, SpaceX, AMD, Qualcomm, NXP, and GM — to help reshore chip production to the U.S. and diversify global supply chains, the press release notes.

    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , GlobalFoundries has seen its adjusted gross margin remain largely within the 20–30% range over the past four years, with analysts citing pricing challenges and rising competitive pressures as key factors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Reuters estimates that GlobalFoundries will report a roughly 4% decline in quarterly revenue to $1.68 billion when it announces results on November 12, based on data compiled by LSEG. The company’s profit is projected to fall 8%, to $165.4 million, the report adds.

 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  NVIDIA is reportedly joining forces with Deutsche Telekom AG to construct a EUR 1 billion (approximately USD 1.16 billion) data center in Germany, marking a significant step in the chipmaker’s effort to strengthen its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure across Europe.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to sources familiar with the matter, both NVIDIA and Deutsche Telekom will jointly fund the project, which forms part of a broader initiative to expand the continent’s AI infrastructure. Europe’s largest software company, SAP SE, is expected to be one of the facility’s key clients.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The project is set to be formally announced next month at an event in Berlin, attended by Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, SAP CEO Christian Klein, and Germany’s Minister for Digital and Transport Affairs Carsten Wiedelberg.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The planned facility is expected to deploy around 10,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). While this represents a major investment for Europe, it is notably smaller in scale than the massive U.S. data center being developed in Texas by SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle, which is projected to house around 500,000 GPUs.

   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cxmt.com/news/info_94.html&quot;&gt;
    CXMT
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  unveiled the latest updates on its LPDDR5X lineup on October 28. The company reported that its 8533Mbps and 9600Mbps products entered mass production in May, while 10667Mbps variants are now being dispatched for customer trials.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At the IEEE 2025 ASICON conference in October, CXMT highlighted the latest progress on its LPDDR5X lineup, which now spans dies, chips, and modules. Die options include 12Gb and 16Gb capacities, while chip-level solutions cover 12GB, 16GB, and 24GB. LPCAMM modules are offered in 16GB and 32GB variants, providing a broad and flexible portfolio for different applications.

 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In late 2023, the company was rumored to complete the development of LPDDR5. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cxmt.com/en/product.html&quot;&gt;
    CXMT
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , its LPDDR5X achieves global mainstream performance with 12Gb/16Gb die capacity and top-tier 10667Mbps speeds – a 66% improvement over LPDDR5 while maintaining full backward compatibility and reducing power consumption by 30%.

   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reported last week that CXMT is gearing up for an IPO in Shanghai as early as Q1 next year, seeking a valuation of up to RMB 300 billion (US$42 billion).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The report suggested the company’s parent began IPO preparations in July, entering China’s so-called “counselling process,” and appointed state-owned investment banks China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and CSC Financial to lead the deal.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Sources cited by Reuters said the IPO is likely to attract strong interest from domestic investors, eager to support China’s semiconductor self-sufficiency drive.

    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  ASML’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools have long been essential to advanced chip manufacturing, with foundries such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel investing heavily to acquire them. Now, a U.S. startup is looking to challenge the Dutch company’s dominance — and ultimately seek to replace TSMC’s role in advanced chip production by boosting U.S. manufacturing capacity. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-startup-substrate-announces-chipmaking-tool-that-it-says-will-rival-asml-2025-10-28/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , Substrate, a San Francisco–based firm, has developed a chipmaking system it claims can rival ASML’s most advanced lithography machines.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/what-is-substrate-a-thiel-backed-chip-startup-seeking-to-crack-asml-s-dominance&quot;&gt;
    Bloomberg
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  indicates, ASML’s EUV machines generate a type of light that enables the etching of features on today’s most advanced chips. Substrate is taking a different approach. According to Bloomberg, the company’s system uses a particle accelerator to generate light from shorter-wavelength X-rays, a method it claims can produce even narrower and more precise beams.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Substrate’s system, demonstrated at U.S. national laboratories, is said to be capable of producing chips at the 2nm process, according to the startup’s founder and CEO James Proud, as cited by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/2496edef-4f1b-47aa-877d-9c01271faaa1&quot;&gt;
    Financial Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  . Proud claims that his approach could cut the cost of manufacturing a leading-edge wafer from about $100,000 to roughly $10,000 by the end of this decade, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Substrate Sets Sights on TSMC
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, Substrate’s ultimate goal is not just to replace ASML, but to challenge TSMC, the world’s largest foundry. According to Reuters, Proud said the company’s tool marks the first step in building a U.S.-based contract chipmaking business capable of competing with TSMC in advanced AI chip production. As
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/peter-thiel-backed-startup-secures-100-million-to-make-chips-in-u-s-baff93ac&quot;&gt;
    The Wall Street Journal
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  notes, the company plans to build a network of its own fabs equipped with its lithography machines, aiming to begin large-scale chip production by 2028.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Steep Technical Hurdles Ahead
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Despite the startup’s ambitious plans, industry experts caution that achieving such precision is a feat that typically takes a decade to master — and it represents only one link in a long chain of technical challenges. The Wall Street Journal notes that advanced semiconductor production also requires maintaining that same level of accuracy across much larger wafer areas while operating at high speeds. Chinese firms, the report adds, have spent years trying to overcome similar obstacles.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, Bloomberg notes that the company has attracted notable backers. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund joined early investors including General Catalyst and Valor Equity Partners. Bloomberg also adds the company claims that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has met with Substrate’s founder several times.

     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At NVIDIA’s first-ever Washington GTC from October 27-29, CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against AI bubble concerns while unveiling the next-generation Vera Rubin superchip. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/nvidia-jensen-huang-gtc-washington-dc-ai.html&quot;&gt;
    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , he projected combined GPU revenue of $500 billion from the Blackwell lineup and next year’s Rubin release, noting that demand remains strong with 6 million Blackwell units shipped over the past four quarters.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3165871/nvidia-nvda-ceo-dismisses-ai-bubble-concerns-projects-500-billion-revenue&quot;&gt;
    gurufocus
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  notes that Huang expects 20 million units of the new generation to ship, up from 4 million of the prior Hopper series. He reportedly emphasized that current AI models are driving substantial infrastructure investments, helping to calm market fears of an AI bubble.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As CNBC highlights, AI hyperscalers are ramping up plans to build massive supercomputing data centers, largely powered by NVIDIA AI processors, to handle soaring workloads. Citing analysts, the report suggests total hyperscaler capital expenditures are expected to climb 24% next year, reaching nearly $550 billion.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Huang: No NVIDIA Export Licenses Filed Amid China Curbs
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At GTC, Huang also raised concerns about the Chinese market. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nvidias-huang-speak-washington-investors-look-hints-china-2025-10-28/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , he said China has effectively blocked NVIDIA, and the company has not sought U.S. export licenses for its latest processors because of Beijing’s stance. “They’ve made it very clear they don’t want NVIDIA there right now,” Huang told reporters, adding that he hopes that changes in the future, as China remains a very important market.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Back in September, China accused NVIDIA of breaking its anti-monopoly law after the Trump administration arranged a revenue-sharing deal allowing the U.S. AI chip maker to export H20 chips. Since then, Huang reportedly said NVIDIA’s share of the Chinese market has dropped from 95% all the way to zero.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At GTC, Jensen Huang highlighted that NVIDIA’s fastest AI chips, the Blackwell GPUs, are now rolling off production lines in Arizona, reinforcing the company’s commitment to U.S. manufacturing. Reuters notes that the chips are produced at TSMC facilities in Arizona, with servers assembled in Texas and networking equipment built in California.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Vera Rubin Unveiled
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As per
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.technews.tw/2025/10/29/nvidias-vera-rubin-superchip-debuts-at-gtc/&quot;&gt;
    TechNews
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , at the GTC October 2025 event held in Washington, Jensen Huang unveiled the company’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip for the first time. He revealed that the motherboard will integrate one Vera CPU with two Rubin GPUs, support up to 32 LPDDR memory channels, and feature HBM4 high-bandwidth memory on the GPUs.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Huang noted that the Rubin GPUs have returned to the lab for testing as the first samples manufactured by TSMC, according to TechNews. Each GPU reportedly includes eight HBM4 interfaces and two reticle-sized GPU dies. The Vera CPU features 88 custom Arm-based cores, supporting up to 176 threads.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to NVIDIA’s plan, Rubin GPUs are expected to enter mass production in the third or fourth quarter of 2026, roughly in line with—or potentially earlier than—the full-scale production of the current Blackwell Ultra GB300 Superchip platform, the report notes.

  A major shake-up is underway in the RF chip industry as Qorvo and
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.skyworksinc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/skyworks-and-qorvo-combine-create-22-billion-us-based-leader&quot;&gt;
    Skyworks
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  —two of Apple’s key suppliers—agree to merge. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-supplier-skyworks-held-talks-buy-8-billion-rival-qorvo-information-reports-2025-10-28/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , Skyworks Solutions said on Tuesday that it will acquire smaller rival Qorvo, creating a combined company valued at around $22 billion. The deal will form one of the largest U.S. suppliers of radio-frequency chips, aiming to capture a recovery in smartphone demand following the post-pandemic slowdown, while also facing headwinds from Apple’s push to develop more chips in-house.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As the report notes, Skyworks CEO Phil Brace will lead the newly merged company as chief executive, while Qorvo’s Bob Bruggeworth will join its board of directors. Upon completion of the transaction, Skyworks shareholders are expected to own about 63% of the combined firm, with Qorvo investors holding the remaining 37% on a fully diluted basis. The companies anticipate that the deal will close in early 2027.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Apple’s efforts to develop its own radio chips, first introduced in the iPhone 16e earlier this year, could gradually reduce its reliance on suppliers such as Skyworks and Qorvo, potentially weighing on their long-term revenue. Both companies depend heavily on Apple’s orders, with nearly two-thirds of Skyworks’ revenue coming from the iPhone maker, while Qorvo generates almost half of its sales from Apple, as highlighted by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/9102855?from=edn_related_storybottom&quot;&gt;
    Economic Daily News
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At the same time, Reuters notes that the merger—bringing together two major U.S. RF chipmakers—is likely to face antitrust scrutiny, given the firms’ leading positions in the smartphone component market.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   U.S. RF Chip Merger Strengthens Global Position
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Despite potential regulatory hurdles, Economic Daily News points out that the merger could also create a more competitive American player in the wireless connectivity chip sector. The move aligns with broader efforts by the U.S. and European governments to strengthen their semiconductor industries and reduce reliance on Asia.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Similarly,
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forecastock.tw/article/cmoneyairesearcher-b69462d7-b3f5-11f0-bdb9-31044b982b21&quot;&gt;
    CMoney
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , citing industry sources, indicates that the merger will enable the combined company to better withstand competition from Chinese and South Korean rivals, enhance its bargaining power, lower manufacturing costs, and deliver a more attractive product lineup to Apple and other global device brands.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, institutional investors also warn, according to CMoney, that large semiconductor mergers often face early-stage integration challenges, including R&amp;D culture alignment, customer coordination, and production scheduling. In addition, major clients such as Apple may seize the opportunity to renegotiate prices, creating short-term operational uncertainty even as the merger seeks longer-term strategic gains.

  While Samsung is on track to post its best Q3 profit in three years on the back of AI-driven chip price gains, SK hynix also sent strong signals. On the 29th, the company reported a consolidated operating profit of KRW 11.38 trillion for 3Q25—up 62% YoY with a 47% margin—marking the first time its profit has surpassed the KRW 10 trillion milestone, according to

   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Here’s a summary of three key takeaways from the earnings report: HBM4 progress, CAPEX plans, and DRAM and NAND outlook.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   HBM4 Shipments Start in Q4; 2026 Price Talks with Clients Concluded
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  SK hynix has confirmed that all 2026 HBM supply negotiations with key customers are complete. HBM4, which finished development in September, meets all performance requirements and is ready to deliver the industry’s fastest speeds. Shipments begin in Q4, with sales scaling up next year. The Chosun Daily and ZDNet suggest NVIDIA is likely among the confirmed clients.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20250918-12719.html&quot;&gt;
   TrendForce
  &lt;/a&gt;
  notes that NVIDIA has recently pressed key component suppliers of its Vera Rubin server racks to upgrade product specifications, specifically requesting that HBM4 speed per pin be raised to 10 Gbps, as AMD gets set to launch its MI450 Helios platform in 2026. While the success of these upgrades remains uncertain, SK hynix is expected to stay the leading supplier in HBM4’s early mass-production phase, TrendForce adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;

  highlights, with stronger finances and growing demand, SK hynix plans to boost investment in 2026. The company follows a principle of maintaining its CAPEX at around the mid-30% level of sales, based on a three-year moving average, the report suggests.
 &lt;/p&gt;

    News1
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  highlights that SK hynix sees higher investment in the memory sector as inevitable to meet rapidly growing demand, with next year’s CAPEX expected to rise “significantly.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The report adds that infrastructure investment will continue expanding next year, including preparations for the Yongin Cluster 1 and the Advanced Package Plant in Indiana, USA. At the same time, the company is boosting new capacity with M15X—whose cleanroom reportedly opened ahead of schedule and has begun equipment installation.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=254969#google_vignette&quot;&gt;
    Business Korea
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , SK hynix has started installing key equipment at its Cheongju M15X fab, which will produce HBM and other products. The facility is slated for completion by year-end, with production set to begin next year, the report notes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As an expansion of the M15 fab, M15X carries an investment of over KRW 20 trillion, with construction expected to finish by the end of this year, Business Korea reports.
 &lt;/p&gt;

   DRAM &amp; NAND Forecast: 4Q25 Performance and 2026 Outlook
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skhynix.com/ir/UI-FR-IR06/&quot;&gt;
    SK hynix
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , it projects another strong quarter in 4Q, expecting DRAM and NAND sales to rise by low single digits quarter over quarter. In 2026, the company expects DRAM demand to rise more than 20% year on year, following high-teen growth in 2025. NAND demand is also projected to grow robustly, reaching the high teens in 2026, up from mid-teen growth in 2025.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  SK hynix explains that memory demand is rising sharply as KV Cache is sequentially offloaded from HBM to conventional DRAM and SSD, while multiple requests are processed in parallel. This is creating a structural shift in demand for both DRAM (HBM, high-performance DDR5) and NAND (eSSD), the company says.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  To meet demand, SK hynix plans to speed up the transition to its advanced 10nm-class sixth-generation (1c) process, already in stable mass production, and expand DRAM supply across servers, mobile, and graphics segments. For NAND, the company aims to boost output of its 321-layer product—the world’s highest-layered offering—to quickly satisfy customer needs.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On October 22, data released by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Statistics showed that the city’s gross domestic product (GDP) reached CNY 4.072 trillion in the first three quarters of 2025, representing a year-on-year growth of 5.5%.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The combined output value of Shanghai’s three leading industries—integrated circuit (IC), biomedicine, and artificial intelligence—increased by 8.5% year-on-year. Among them, the IC manufacturing sector posted an impressive 11.3% growth, emerging as a key driver of the city’s industrial expansion.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Shanghai’s burgeoning growth is underpinned by a comprehensive policy framework. Over the past several years, the city has launched a series of systematic measures covering financial support, targeted subsidies, and talent recruitment, forming a well-integrated policy ecosystem.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Aside from policy backing, Shanghai has also established multiple dedicated funds in the semiconductor and IC sectors, spanning mergers and acquisitions, industrial investment, and venture capital.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Today, Shanghai’s integrated circuit industry has evolved into a technologically advanced and fully integrated ecosystem encompassing the entire value chain—from design and manufacturing to packaging, testing, equipment, materials, and EDA/IP. The city is now home to more than 1,200 IC-related enterprises by far.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notable players include chip design firms such as UNISOC, Montage Technology, OmniVision Group (formerly Will Semiconductor), VeriSilicon, and Giantec Semiconductor; manufacturers such as SMIC, Hua Hong Group, and GTA; as well as equipment and materials companies including SMEE, AMEC, ACM, Hwatsing, PNC, NSIG and Anji.

   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While memory giants are reportedly raising DRAM prices by up to 30% in Q4 on strong HBM demand, NAND flash is proving to be just as hot a commodity. According to
  &lt;span&gt;

    New Daily
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , Samsung, SK hynix, and Kioxia are running their SSD production lines at full capacity, with some models now facing delivery delays of more than a year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, High-capacity products of 8TB or more are particularly tight, with most shipments already booked through the second half of next year, New Daily notes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251014-12744.html&quot;&gt;
   TrendForce
  &lt;/a&gt;
  observes that the massive data volumes generated by AI are straining the global infrastructure of data center storage. Nearline HDDs, traditionally the backbone of large-scale data storage, are now facing severe supply shortages, pushing high-performance yet higher-cost SSDs into the market spotlight. In particular, shipments of high-capacity QLC SSDs could see explosive growth in 2026, as per TrendForce.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  TrendForce noted in mid-September that lead times for nearline HDDs have stretched to as long as 52 weeks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  New Daily explains that, unlike HDDs which rely on spinning disks to store data, SSDs write information directly onto NAND flash memory. This architecture reportedly gives SSDs a clear advantage: they can access data dozens of times faster, use far less power, and produce much less heat and noise—making them ideal for demanding tasks like AI training and inference.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Memory Giants Move to Respond
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  TrendForce reports that in response, HDD and SSD makers are expanding high-capacity storage. According to TrendForce, with HDD supply tight, NAND flash vendors are accelerating tech upgrades and boosting production of ultra-high-capacity nearline SSDs, including 122TB and 245TB models, easing concerns over long-term demand.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  New Daily reports that prices for 200+ layer NAND used in enterprise SSDs are soaring amid a tightening supply, prompting suppliers to swiftly recalibrate production plans. The report notes Samsung has launched a lineup of PCIe 5.0 SSDs for data centers, expanded long-term deals with major U.S. and European cloud providers, and is gearing up for mass production of its next-gen 300-layer NAND.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, SK hynix—through its subsidiary Solidigm—is reportedly strengthening its foothold in the North American data center market, operating a dedicated SSD production line tailored for AI servers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Legacy HDD leaders such as Seagate and Western Digital, according to the report, are responding by scaling back production lines or pivoting toward SSD-focused operations.
 &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  NVIDIA recently marked a major milestone, celebrating the first Blackwell wafer produced on U.S. soil at TSMC’s fab—an achievement that underscores their deepening partnership. That collaboration may soon expand further. According to South Korean outlet
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1683939&quot;&gt;
    EBN News
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , citing industry sources, NVIDIA is currently the sole customer for TSMC’s forthcoming “A16” node, with the two companies conducting joint testing ahead of its expected deployment around 2027. This would mark a key turning point, as it would be the first time AI applications lead the adoption of TSMC’s most advanced process technology, as noted by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20250915700077-439901&quot;&gt;
    Commercial Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, EBN News, citing sources, adds that Apple has yet to begin discussions with TSMC about adopting the A16 process for its mobile application processors (APs).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  NVIDIA’s GPU roadmap progresses from Hopper to Blackwell, Rubin, and finally Feynman. The Blackwell lineup is currently in production, while Rubin is scheduled for launch next year. As EBN News notes, the Feynman GPU, planned for 2028, is expected to be built using TSMC’s A16 process. Although its release is still about three years away, the company is likely to begin ramping up A16 production in the second half of 2027, allowing roughly a year to optimize yield and manufacturing efficiency.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Rising Costs Loom as NVIDIA Prepares to Adopt TSMC’s A16 Node
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The report from EBN News notes that NVIDIA has so far refrained from using TSMC’s most advanced nodes for its GPUs. Hopper and Blackwell are built on the 4nm process, while Rubin uses 3nm technology. This strategy, the report adds, has allowed the company to maintain exceptionally high operating profit margins—reaching 61% in the second quarter of fiscal 2026.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, EBN News highlights that cost pressures are expected to mount starting with the Feynman generation, as NVIDIA transitions to TSMC’s most advanced node. With the foundry sharply raising prices for its most advanced processes, manufacturing costs are projected to rise significantly between 2027 and 2028, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/logic/l_A16&quot;&gt;
    TSMC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  ’s website notes that A16 integrates advanced nanosheet transistors with its Super Power Rail (SPR) solution. Compared with the N2P process, A16 delivers an 8–10% speed gain at the same voltage, a 15–20% power reduction at the same speed, and up to 1.1× chip density, making it well suited for high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The battle for AI data center dominance is heating up.
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/10/qualcomm-unveils-ai200-and-ai250-redefining-rack-scale-data-cent&quot;&gt;
    Qualcomm
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , long focused on mobile chips, has unveiled its next-generation AI inference processors — the AI200 and AI250 — taking direct aim at NVIDIA and AMD. Notably, according to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-new-ai-rack-scale-solution-actually-uses-lpddr-mobile-memory-onboard/&quot;&gt;
    Wccftech
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , Qualcomm has shifted away from using HBM in its new chips, opting instead for a design built around mobile-oriented LPDDR memory. Wccftech also points out that the new chips feature up to 768 GB of LPDDR memory on the accelerator package, significantly exceeding the capacity of typical HBM solutions in the industry.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As the company’s press release notes, the Qualcomm AI200 supports up to 768 GB of LPDDR per card, offering higher memory capacity and lower cost to enable greater scalability and flexibility for AI inference. The AI250, meanwhile, debuts an innovative near-memory computing architecture that delivers over 10× higher effective memory bandwidth and reduced power consumption.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The adoption of LPDDR over HBM is said to provide higher memory density and better thermal efficiency, as Wccftech indicates. However, Wccftech also notes that Qualcomm’s rack-scale solutions still lag behind mainstream offerings from NVIDIA and AMD, as avoiding HBM leads to lower memory bandwidth, higher latency from a narrower interface, and potential reliability issues under continuous high-temperature server conditions.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Inside Qualcomm’s AI200 and AI250
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Both the Qualcomm AI200 and AI250 accelerators are built on its Hexagon NPUs, customized for data center AI workloads. However, as
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/qualcomm-unveils-ai200-and-ai250-ai-inference-accelerators-hexagon-takes-on-amd-and-nvidia-in-the-booming-data-center-realm&quot;&gt;
    Tom’s Hardware
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  notes, one key detail Qualcomm has not revealed about its AI200 and AI250 rack-scale inference systems is which processors will power them.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In addition to their NPU and memory architecture, Qualcomm’s press release states that both rack solutions feature direct liquid cooling for enhanced thermal efficiency, PCIe for scale-up capability, Ethernet for scale-out connectivity, confidential computing for secure AI workloads, and a rack-level power consumption of 160 kW.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Per Qualcomm’s press release, the AI200 and AI250 accelerators are slated for commercial release in 2026 and 2027, respectively.
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/qualcomm-unveils-chip-to-rival-nvidia-in-ai-accelerator-market&quot;&gt;
    Bloomberg
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports that the first customer may be Saudi Arabia’s AI startup Humain, which plans to deploy 200 megawatts of computing capacity based on the chips beginning in 2026.

     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As the race for sub-2nm dominance intensifies among foundries, Intel is reportedly targeting a recently retired TSMC executive to spearhead its key R&amp;D efforts. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/5226050&quot;&gt;
    Liberty Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , just three months after retiring, former TSMC Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy Development Wei-Jen Lo is rumored to be joining Intel to take on the role.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The rumor is particularly sensitive given Lo’s 21 years at TSMC, where he held senior operational and R&amp;D roles and gained deep knowledge of the company’s trade secrets. Liberty Times reports that TSMC executives are reportedly aware of the news.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If confirmed, the move could have significant implications for TSMC and the broader Taiwanese semiconductor industry, especially as Intel aggressively expands its foundry business with support from Washington and backing from tech giants like NVIDIA and SoftBank, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Lo’s Importance to TSMC
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As per
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20251028701044-430501&quot;&gt;
    Commercial Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , under Lo’s leadership, TSMC’s technology team secured more than 1,500 patents, including around 1,000 in the United States, laying a solid foundation for the company’s advanced process and R&amp;D capabilities.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  He is also said to have enjoyed the deep trust of TSMC founder Morris Chang. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=4280&quot;&gt;
    CommonWealth Magazine
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , when Lo retired this past July, he was TSMC’s longest-serving executive. Although the company’s official retirement age is 67—with extensions requiring annual board approval—Lo remained in his role until 75, two years senior to CEO C.C. Wei, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  CommonWealth Magazine, citing industry sources, describes him as the most enigmatic of TSMC’s veteran leaders, noting that he maintained an exceptionally low profile and always stayed in the background, who wouldn’t even put his name on academic papers. However, as per
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itri.org.tw/ListStyle.aspx?DisplayStyle=18_content&amp;SiteID=1&amp;MmmID=1036452026061075714&amp;MGID=1311116000767134254&quot;&gt;
    ITRI
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , over more than two decades at TSMC, he led teams in overcoming technical bottlenecks, playing a pivotal role in driving EUV lithography and the mass production of advanced nodes including 5nm, 3nm, and 2nm.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Speculation and Doubts
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Regarding the latest rumor, Liberty Times points out that Lo previously worked at Intel and that his leadership style was shaped by his time there. However, industry insiders cited by the report say it is unlikely he would join Intel again, given TSMC’s non-compete rules, Intel’s status as a direct competitor, Lo’s advanced age, health considerations, and his long-standing loyalty to TSMC founder Morris Chang.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, some industry observers warn that Lo, a U.S. citizen, would be difficult for TSMC to restrict, even with non-compete clauses. Yet the report adds that foundry is a team effort, and it remains uncertain whether he could significantly boost Intel’s mass production or yields. Intel may also be leveraging the prestige of a former TSMC veteran as part of a broader foundry strategy, the report notes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Intel’s 18A has just entered mass production with its in-house processor Panther Lake. However, as
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tweaktown.com/news/108457/intel-ceo-on-panther-lake-launch-in-q1-2026-first-step-with-new-cpus-on-intel-18a-process-node/index.html&quot;&gt;
    TweakTown
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports, the graphics tile (GPU) is still manufactured by TSMC on its N3E process, while the SoC/I/O tile is produced using TSMC’s N6 process.

 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The wave of tech layoffs continues. With cost pressures mounting and AI reshaping corporate priorities, more companies across the industry are trimming staff. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , citing sources, Amazon plans to cut up to 30,000 corporate jobs starting Tuesday to reduce costs and address overhiring during the pandemic. As cited by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html&quot;&gt;
    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , data from Layoffs.fyi show that the planned cuts would be the largest in the tech industry since at least 2020.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As Reuters notes, this would be Amazon’s largest round of layoffs since late 2022, when the company cut about 27,000 jobs. While the figure represents only a small portion of Amazon’s 1.55 million total employees, it accounts for nearly 10% of its roughly 350,000 corporate staff, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Sources cited by Reuters said the cuts may affect several divisions, including human resources, known internally as People Experience and Technology (PXT), as well as operations, devices, services, and Amazon Web Services.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Amid these job reductions, the report adds, AWS’s growth has slowed compared with competitors. According to Reuters, Amazon’s primary profit engine, its cloud computing arm AWS, generated second-quarter sales of $30.9 billion, up 17.5% year over year—well below the 39% growth posted by Microsoft’s Azure and 32% by Alphabet’s Google Cloud.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Amazon isn’t alone in trimming its workforce. As noted by CNBC, more than 200 tech companies have laid off roughly 98,000 employees since the start of the year. CNBC reports that Microsoft has cut about 15,000 jobs so far in 2025, while Meta last week eliminated around 600 positions in its artificial intelligence division. Google, meanwhile, let go of more than 100 design-related employees in its cloud unit earlier this month.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Applied Materials Cuts 4% of Workforce
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Beyond cloud providers, chip equipment maker Applied Materials is cutting about 4% of its global workforce. The company began notifying affected employees worldwide last week “across all levels and groups,” according to a
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000006951/000162828025046107/amat-20251023.htm&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  cited by

    CNBC
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  CNBC notes that Applied Materials had about 36,100 full-time employees as of an August 2025 filing, meaning the reduction would affect roughly 1,400 workers. The layoffs come at the end of the company’s fiscal year. Earlier this month, according to CNBC, Applied Materials projected a $600 million decline in fiscal 2026 revenue following the U.S. expansion of its export restrictions.

 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Apple’s first foldable iPhone—expected in 2026 and reportedly featuring a design similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold, according to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras&quot;&gt;
    Bloomberg
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  —is drawing strong market attention. Yet its biggest upgrade may lie inside: the device will run on Apple’s new A20 Pro chip, built on TSMC’s 2nm process, as reported by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20251028700080-439901&quot;&gt;
    Commercial Times
   &lt;/a&gt;

    cnBeta.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Commercial Times notes that Apple has already secured most of TSMC’s initial 2nm capacity for the A20 lineup, which will debut next year. As per cnBeta, the A20 series is expected to be the first iPhone processor built on TSMC’s 2nm process, succeeding the 3nm-based A17 Pro through A19 Pro chips.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Citing the Weibo account “Mobile Chip Expert,” cnBeta adds that the standard iPhone 18 will use the A20, while the iPhone 18 Pro and foldable iPhone will feature the A20 Pro. However, the source cited by the report did not specify which chip will be used in the entry-level iPhone 18e or the second-generation iPhone Air.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20250722-12649.html&quot;&gt;
   TrendForce
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Apple is likely to launch its first foldable phone in the second half of next year, featuring a 5.5-inch external display and a 7.8-inch internal display. If confirmed, Apple’s entry is expected to significantly boost consumer interest and acceptance of foldables, particularly among high-end users.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   2nm Battleground for Smartphone Chipmakers
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Compared with this year’s 3nm process, TSMC’s 2nm technology promises a significant leap—performance gains of up to 15% and power savings of around 30%, according to the company—further advancing Apple’s push for in-house silicon.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, Apple won’t be the only one on TSMC’s 2nm node, though it may be slightly ahead. Commercial Times reports that 2026 marks TSMC’s first year of 2nm commercialization, with Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek all racing to launch products.
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediatek.com/press-room/mediatek-develops-chip-utilizing-tsmcs-2nm-process-achieving-milestones-in-performance-andpower-efficiency&quot;&gt;
    MediaTek
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , for example, announced in September the tape-out of its first 2nm flagship SoC, likely the Dimensity 9600, with mass production slated for late 2026.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, Commercial Times adds that with 2nm capacity tight, Apple’s bulk preorders secure both pricing power and strategic control.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Apple Silicon Expands Across Devices with TSMC
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Industry observers cited by Commercial Times note that thanks to TSMC’s advanced processes, Apple Silicon now powers nearly every key module across Apple devices, not just core processors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The report further notes that Apple’s lineup this year already includes the C1X and N1 (Wi-Fi) chips, built on TSMC’s 4nm and 6nm nodes. Next year, Apple’s in-house C2 chip, debuting on TSMC’s 4nm process, is expected to power the iPhone 18 series as well, further extending Apple’s silicon integration, according to Commercial Times.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, Commercial Times suggests that Apple’s newly upgraded AirPods Pro 3, which adds real-time translation features, also features the company’s in-house H2 SoC, while its charging case houses the U2 chip, a 7nm design that enables UWB and short-range communication capabilities.

  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/db/887/9148/prepared_remarks/3Q2025+Earnings+Call+Prepared+Remarks.pdf&quot;&gt;
    Intel
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reported a return to profitability, noting that demand for some of its older process chips remains strong. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/2025/intel-warns-of-cpu-shortage-as-it-reports-improved-execution-for-comeback-plan?itc=refresh&quot;&gt;
    CRN
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , the company also cautioned that CPU shortages could persist well into next year as demand continues to outpace supply.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In its press release, Intel CFO Dave Zinsner said third-quarter revenue reached $13.7 billion, exceeding the high end of guidance and rising 6% sequentially. He noted that capacity constraints, particularly on Intel 10 and Intel 7, limited the company’s ability to fully meet demand for data center and client products during the quarter.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Further addressing the outlook for demand outpacing supply into 2026, Zinsner said Intel expects shortages to peak in the first quarter next year, explaining that after managing Q3 and Q4 with limited inventory, “we’re going to be really, really tight in Q1,” according to a transcript from
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-intel-q3-2025-beats-earnings-expectations-stock-rises-93CH-4306387&quot;&gt;
    Investing.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Zinsner added that shortages extend across much of the business, with capacity especially tight on Intel 10 and Intel 7. He noted that Intel does not plan to expand capacity for those nodes, meaning constraints will persist as demand rises. To mitigate the impact, the company is redirecting customer demand to alternative products. Zinsner also pointed to broader industry issues, such as substrate shortages, which are compounding the supply challenge, as indicated by the earnings call transcript from Investing.com.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   AI PC Adoption Slower Than Expected as Users Favor Older Chips
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Regarding AI PC sales, which appear to be progressing more slowly compared with the strong demand for older-node processors, Zinsner said that sales of Intel’s AI products rose by double digits quarter over quarter. He added that the company expects to ship around 100 million AI PC units by the end of this year and is actively working to help the broader ecosystem develop more applications for AI in the PC market.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Zinsner also noted that the Windows refresh is unfolding more strongly than the company had anticipated. According to CRN, despite Intel and other firms promoting AI PCs powered by newer processors such as Lunar Lake as an upgrade path to Windows 11, many users are instead choosing to upgrade using less advanced hardware.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As noted by CRN, products built on the Intel 10 and Intel 7 nodes include the 14th-generation Core “Raptor Lake Refresh” and 5th-generation Xeon Scalable “Emerald Rapids” series, both launched in 2023. CRN also mentions that newer products such as the Core Ultra 200V “Lunar Lake” and Core Ultra Series 2 “Arrow Lake” lineups rely fully or nearly fully on TSMC for production.

    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia and dismissed its Chinese CEO, sending shockwaves through the global semiconductor industry. According to
  &lt;span&gt;

    Wingtech
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  stated in its earnings filing that if it fails to regain operational control of its European subsidiary, Nexperia could face temporary pressure on revenue, profit, and cash flow due to governance issues, even as the company reported a 280% surge in quarterly net profit.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As Tom’s Hardware notes, although Wingtech’s earnings release did not explicitly mention the Dutch government, the reference was clear. Nexperia is one of the world’s leading suppliers of commodity components such as diodes, MOSFETs, and small-signal logic used in voltage regulation modules and ESD protection. Should geopolitical tensions disrupt operations or investment plans, Nexperia could face longer lead times and higher input costs.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The turmoil at Nexperia is already reverberating through the global automotive industry. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3330305/nexperia-crisis-sino-dutch-dispute-over-chipmaker-puts-car-industry-supply-chain-risk&quot;&gt;
    South China Morning Post
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association revealed that Nexperia had informed Japanese car parts makers it may no longer be able to guarantee chip deliveries.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Against this backdrop, Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume — whose company owns Audi and Porsche — said that Volkswagen’s short-term chip supply remains stable for now, but warned that the situation is precarious and requires a swift political solution to prevent future disruptions, as noted by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/volkswagen-is-ok-chip-supply-now-ceo-tells-bild-am-sonntag-2025-10-26/&quot;&gt;

  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Nexperia China Resumes Domestic Shipments in Yuan
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Despite the tensions, Nexperia’s headquarters remained confident about the company’s operations in China. As noted by South China Morning Post, a representative from the Dutch head office said the firm was not “stepping away from its Chinese activities.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Nexperia China has instructed its employees to follow directives from local management and disregard orders from the Dutch headquarters, as reported by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3329565/nexperia-china-tells-employees-ignore-orders-dutch-head-office&quot;&gt;
    South China Morning Post
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;
    , citing sources.
   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  In an open challenge to the head office in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, the company declared itself an “independent” Chinese entity and stressed that employee salaries were paid by the local unit rather than the headquarters.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In addition, Nexperia China has resumed semiconductor shipments to domestic distributors, according to sources cited by
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nexperias-china-unit-resumes-chip-sales-domestic-distributors-sources-say-2025-10-23/&quot;&gt;
    Reuters
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  . However, the restart is confined to local transactions, with all distributor payments now required to be settled in Chinese yuan — a move seen as an effort to stabilize supply within China and reinforce operational independence from its Dutch parent.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, as Reuters reports, Nexperia is also exploring alternative packaging partners outside China, with its dispute with the Chinese subsidiary showing no signs of being resolved anytime soon.

       .
      &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As DRAM giants continue to hike prices amid a memory supercycle—driven by tight supply of legacy products like DDR4—the smartphone supply chain is feeling the heat. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20251027700175-439901&quot;&gt;
    Commercial Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , citing smartphone makers, delivery lead times for DRAM and NAND have stretched dramatically, with LPDDR5X now taking 26–39 weeks, meaning orders placed today might not arrive until mid-2026.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The upward price trend shows no signs of slowing, and cost pressures for processor makers and smartphone brands are mounting. Analysts told Commercial Times that MediaTek could be among the first to feel the margin squeeze, while
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eet-china.com/news/202510247553.html&quot;&gt;
    EE Times China
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  reports that Xiaomi has already been forced to adjust prices in response to the surge.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   MediaTek in Spotlight
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Commercial Times warns that MediaTek’s smartphone chip margins could come under pressure as early as 4Q25, driven by rising memory and foundry costs. As chip production shifts to 2nm nodes in 2026, performance will improve, but wafer costs are also expected to rise significantly, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Commercial Times further notes that standard smartphones now typically ship with 12GB memory, and high-end configurations are increasing. To offset costs, SoC vendors have already raised average selling prices (ASPs) to offset higher costs, suggesting smartphone prices could climb further, as highlighted by the report.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Xiaomi Feels the Heat from Soaring Memory Costs
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Interestingly, EE Times China notes that when the Redmi K90 launched on October 23, prices jumped CNY 300–600 from the previous generation, with a CNY 600 gap between models sharing the same RAM but different storage—sparking user debate.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to EE Times China, the 12GB+256GB standard edition was priced at CNY 2,599, while the 12GB+512GB version went for CNY 3,199—a CNY 600 difference for only an extra 256GB of storage.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Responding on Weibo, Xiaomi founder Lei Jun admitted that recent memory price hikes have been overwhelming. The company quickly adjusted, cutting the 12GB+512GB standard edition by CNY 300 in its first-month sale to CNY 2,899, according to EE Times China.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The report notes that Xiaomi President Lu Weibing explained that upstream cost pressures have already fed into the pricing of new products. He noted that global supply chain trends are beyond the company’s control, with memory costs surging far beyond expectations and continuing to intensify.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Mid- and Low-End Smartphones Hit Hard
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Supply chain sources cited by the report note that major memory suppliers—including Samsung, SK hynix, and Micron—plan further price increases of up to 30% in Q4. As a result, the Redmi K90 is not alone: the report suggests that the vivo X300 series rose by CNY 100–300, OPPO Find X9 increased CNY 200–300, Realme GT8 jumped CNY 300–500, and the iQOO 15 series starting price climbed from CNY 3,999 to 4,199, roughly a 5% increase.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  EE Times China reports that mid- and low-end smartphones are especially sensitive to cost swings. Xu Qi, President of Realme China, noted that for iQOO, the biggest expenses come from the display and memory, adding that price hikes affect not only launch pricing but also the entire product lifecycle, including major promotional periods, the report adds.

       .
      &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As price negotiations for mature-node foundry services enter a critical stage, Taiwan’s foundries have reportedly moved early to adapt to market shifts by pressing upstream suppliers for price cuts. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20251027700062-439901&quot;&gt;
    Commercial Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , both Taiwan’s second-largest foundry UMC and TSMC’s affiliate VIS face pressure in negotiating 2026 pricing agreements with customers, with sources saying UMC took the lead by asking suppliers to propose at least a 15% reduction starting that year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As the report points out, citing industry sources, UMC’s 15% cost-reduction request will cover various supply segments, including chemicals, specialty gases, substrate materials, consumables, and maintenance services. Some material suppliers are reportedly considering offering phased discounts in exchange for two- to three-year contracts and minimum purchase commitments.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Industry sources cited by the report interpret this move as an effort by UMC to gain cost flexibility from upstream suppliers before negotiating prices with downstream clients, aiming to preserve its average selling price (ASP) and cash flow.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Mature-Node Price War Tests Taiwan’s Foundry Strategies
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the client side, the report points out that IC design companies remain cautious about 2026 demand for mature-node processes. This has weakened foundries’ bargaining power and reduced order visibility. The report adds that with mature-node capacity in China and Southeast Asia expanding and drawing away low- to mid-end chip orders, pricing strategy and customer retention will be critical for Taiwanese foundries over the next two years.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Facing the ongoing price war, the report notes, citing industry sources, that UMC is focusing on specialty processes to strengthen differentiation while maintaining utilization through modest discounts tied to long-term contracts. As
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.udn.com/money/story/5710/9096201&quot;&gt;
    Economic Daily News
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  notes, UMC’s main production still centers on the 22/28 nm nodes. Looking ahead, the report highlights that the ramp-up of 55 nm BCD production, along with shipment trends in automotive and industrial power management ICs, will impact its utilization rates and ASPs.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, VIS is leveraging stable demand in automotive, power management IC, and MCU applications, along with high yields and localized services, to pursue joint development and validation with Taiwanese design houses, as Commercial Times notes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The pricing battle for mature nodes in 2026 will test foundries in three key areas: defending price floors without eroding profit margins; securing two- to three-year contracts with stable terms to enhance order visibility and production flexibility; and strengthening ties with core clients through value-added services such as design support, integrated testing, and co-development, according to Commercial Times.

    &lt;/h5&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  With South Korean DRAM giants reportedly hiking prices by up to 30% recently, China’s memory market is feeling intense pressure. According to
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20251027700116-439901&quot;&gt;
    Commercial Times
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , citing
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cls.cn/detail/2180660&quot;&gt;
    Calian Press
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , some manufacturers have even halted quotations for certain DRAM and NAND flash products, and when prices are quoted, they’re valid for such brief periods that they essentially change on a daily basis.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As per Calian, the pricing pressure has reached even major tech players, with Xiaomi founder Lei Jun acknowledging on
  &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.weibo.cn/u/1749127163?luicode=10000011&amp;lfid=1005051661909073&quot;&gt;
    Weibo
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  on October 24th that memory prices have surged substantially in recent months.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The price pressure is evident across the board. Multiple Chinese module makers told Cailian Press that DDR4 prices from manufacturers have been climbing steadily since Q1. Market data from Manmanbuy App reportedly shows the impact: a Kingston DDR4 desktop memory module that began surging in March now costs more than double its price from a year ago, the report adds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Price Hike Rally to Continue
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In context, TrendForce reports that since HBM consumes over three times the wafer capacity of standard DRAM, memory giants are prioritizing production of higher-margin HBM and DDR5, squeezing supply of legacy products like DDR4 and LPDDR4X used in consumer electronics.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Thus, TrendForce, cited by Cailian Press, projects that DDR4 shortages could extend into the first half of 2026, while overall DRAM prices (including HBM) are expected to climb 13%-18% quarter-over-quarter in Q4.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   AI Demand and Capacity Constraints Fuel Prolonged Price Surge
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Calian Press suggests that the memory industry is notoriously cyclical, with sharp rises typically followed by downturns. Yet this year, memory chip prices have reportedly climbed for over six months, and far from cooling in the fourth quarter, the surge has intensified due to multiple overlapping factors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  TrendForce identifies two distinct drivers behind the price surge: Q2-Q3 2025 increases stemmed from DDR4 end-of-life announcements and pre-emptive stockpiling amid U.S.-China tariff tensions. From Q4 2025 through H1 2026, further hikes are expected as North American data centers accelerate AI server investments, driving demand for DDR5 RDIMM, LPDDR5X, and HBM.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  With capacity expansion lagging behind demand, supply shortages for mature-node products are set to intensify, TrendForce notes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Regarding China’s domestic players, Cailian Press, citing TrendForce, reports that since August the industry has entered a fresh round of price increases. Manufacturers have seen profits expand significantly, while module makers have been actively stockpiling chip and wafer inventories, the report adds.
