<title> The Non-Humanoid Robot Startups Are Rising Too </title>

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;The Non-Humanoid Robot Startups Are Rising Too&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/robot-vacuum.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Despite our acclimatization to the forward march of technology, many of us remain vaguely creeped out by the concept of humanoid robots.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sure, it’d be wonderful to have autonomous machines adept at cleaning the house, harvesting and preparing food, running warehouses and performing a host of generally thankless and burdensome jobs. But must they look like us too?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For many startups, the answer to this question is “no.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    While humanoid robots startups like
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/figure-b5dc&quot;&gt;
     Figure
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apptronik&quot;&gt;
     Apptronik
    &lt;/a&gt;
    have drawn headlines in recent months for big
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/figure-b5dc-series-c--455090e3&quot;&gt;
     funding deals
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and flashy
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://apptronik.com/&quot;&gt;
     prototypes
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , an array of companies working on less-anthropomorphic designs have also secured considerable investment. These include four-legged models, AI-enabled appendages and skilled swimmers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The non-humanoid bot startups getting funded
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    To illustrate, we used Crunchbase data to assemble a sample list of 26 companies in the non-humanoid robot startup sector that have raised rounds in the past few quarters. It’s a varied lot, with focus areas ranging from farming to pool cleaning to massaging.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Bots around town
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The list also features a mix of consumer-facing and industrial use cases, and we figured we’d start by highlighting the first category. It’s not that these bots are necessarily more useful, but rather that being out in public does make it a bit more fun to contemplate.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If recently funded startups have their way, some of the bots we see in action could be taking on more of the everyday drudgery currently shouldered by humans.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Cleaning is one of the big areas. China-based
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/narwal-robotics&quot;&gt;
     Narwal Robotics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which closed a $100 million Series E in April, makes robot vacuums and mops and touts its “

    Bots behind the scenes
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    While we may enjoy gawking at the still-unusual sight of a bot in public making a latte or delivering a restaurant meal, the bulk of funded companies in the non-humanoid bot space are working on models that will do their work behind the scenes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Surgical robots have long been one of the more heavily funded areas, and this holds true for recent investment as well. The largest fundraiser on our list, U.K.-based

     ForSight Robotics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , developer of a robotic platform for ophthalmic surgery, is also scaling up, closing a $125 million Series B in June.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the industrial front, Swiss startup
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anybotics#overview&quot;&gt;
     Anybotics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has raised more than $150 million to develop a four-legged bot optimized for inspections, capable of climbing stairs and avoiding obstacles.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flexiv&quot;&gt;
     Flexiv
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which closed a $100 million Series C this summer, is working on appendage-like, AI-enabled robots that can be adapted for multiple industries.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Agtech also emerged as a favored area for investment.

     Ecorobotix
    &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    is working on technology to kill weeds with lasers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Won’t mistake it for a human
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Of all the above-mentioned startups, none appear to be working on anything that could be remotely confused for a human, even from a distance. This seems logical, considering that so many jobs people have historically done don’t seem ideally suited to our particular form.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If all goes well with these non-humanoid robot startups, perhaps it would leave us humans free to spend more time doing the activities that do seem optimally suited to our form. Sitting on the couch would be high on this author’s list, though I’m sure others could find many more productive pursuits.

<title> Shares of Navan Down 16% In Long-Awaited IPO Debut </title>

<pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 10:50:57 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Shares of Navan Down 16% In Long-Awaited IPO Debut&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Forecast-IPO-resized.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Shares of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/navan&quot;&gt;
     Navan
    &lt;/a&gt;
    were trading at just under $21, down 16% in early first-day trading on Thursday, indicating lackluster investor demand for the long-awaited debut.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Navan, which operates an expense management platform with an emphasis on travel, had priced shares for its offering at $25 each late Wednesday. It was formerly called TripActions, with the company pivoting to a broader platform when revenue reached zero right after the COVID pandemic hit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The offering raised $923.1 million for the company, whose shares are trading on the
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq&quot;&gt;
     Nasdaq
    &lt;/a&gt;
    under the ticker NAVN. It set an initial valuation of around $6.2 billion.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The move to the public markets has been a long time coming for Palo Alto, California-based Navan, which
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/29/tripactions-ipo/#:~:text=Mary%20Ann%20Azevedo,by%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.&quot;&gt;
     reportedly
    &lt;/a&gt;
    first submitted confidential paperwork for a planned offering more than three years ago.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The company had raised $1.2 billion in debt financing and $1 billion in equity funding from venture investors and credit providers, per Crunchbase
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/navan#financials&quot;&gt;
     data
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Major venture stakeholders include
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz&quot;&gt;
     Andreessen Horowitz
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-venture-partners&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zeev-ventures&quot;&gt;
     Zeev Ventures
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Growing revenue
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Navan had revenue of $329 million in the first half of 2025, up 30% year over year. Growth comes as the company has been investing in developing its agentic AI offering, Navan Cognition, to automate more cumbersome tasks around travel planning and reporting.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, the company remains far from profitable. Navan’s net loss for the first half of this year came in just shy of $100 million — up about 7% from the year-earlier period. The loss comes amid higher spending on both R&amp;D and sales and marketing — common for companies on the IPO track — looking to appeal to growth-hungry investors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Per its IPO filing, Navan has incurred net losses in each year since its inception in 2015 and “may not achieve or, if achieved, sustain profitability in the future.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    IPO activity has picked up in 2025, with Navan one of several larger recent debuts, including well-received entries by

<title> Exclusive: Founded By Uber Alumni, Archy Raises $20M To Put Dental Practices ‘On Autopilot’ </title>

&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Exclusive: Founded By Uber Alumni, Archy Raises $20M To Put Dental Practices ‘On Autopilot’&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Money_Rocket.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It was 2021 and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jonathan-rat&quot;&gt;
     Jonathan Rat
    &lt;/a&gt;
    was tired of seeing his wife, a dentist, struggle to maintain the tech stack at her practice.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Rat, who had served as a product manager at companies including
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uber&quot;&gt;
     Uber
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot;&gt;
     Meta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/survey-monkey&quot;&gt;
     SurveyMonkey
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , dug into the problem and discovered that “most of the software used in the industry” was more than 20 years old and still required physical services onsite.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “Most lacked integration with other platforms, were slow and buggy, and impossible to train new employees on,” he recalls.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So Rat teamed up with
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ben-kolin-4b21&quot;&gt;
     Benjamin Kolin
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a former director of engineering at Uber, to start
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grindfoundry&quot;&gt;
     Archy
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , an AI-powered platform that aims “to put dental practices on autopilot.” The pair previously led the rebuilding of Uber’s payment platform that’s still in use today.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “I realized there was a massive need and opportunity for a modern, cloud-based software platform and set out to build that,” Rat told Crunchbase News. “I also realized bigger tech players have been building software for the larger healthcare market but overlooked the $500 billion dental industry.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And now, Archy has just raised $20 million in Series B funding to help it grow even more, it told Crunchbase News exclusively.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/technology-crossover-ventures&quot;&gt;
     TCV
    &lt;/a&gt;
    led the financing, which also included participation from
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bessemer-venture-partners&quot;&gt;
     Bessemer Venture Partners
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crvvc&quot;&gt;
     CRV
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/entree-capital&quot;&gt;
     Entrée Capital
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and 25 practicing dentists who wrote checks as angel investors. The raise brings Archy’s total funding to date to $47 million, Rat said.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     The company raised
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/grindfoundry-series-a--15bb10fd&quot;&gt;
     &lt;span&gt;
      a $15 million Series A
     &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     led by Entrée Capital almost exactly one year ago. Rat confirmed the Series B was an up round, but declined to disclose Archy’s valuation.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    All-in-one tool
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Archy claims to replace more than five existing tools to handle scheduling, charting, billing, imaging, insurance, payments, staffing, messaging and reporting “from one login.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is now building AI agents “to handle the busywork” such as checking eligibility, filing and following up on claims, writing notes, managing patient communications and scheduling, and “turning raw practice data into clear answers,” according to Rat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The startup processes more than $100 million in payments annually across 45 states and has seen roughly 300% year-over-year growth, he said. It currently serves 2.5 million patients and has processed over 35 million X-rays through its platform.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The company claims that mid-sized dental practices report saving around 80 hours a month by using its technology, and are able to avoid “big hardware costs.” For example, Rat said that one practice saved about $50,000 in its first year of using Archy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Dual-revenue model
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    San Jose, California-based Archy operates on a dual-revenue model that combines subscription-based fees with payment processing services, and offers tiered monthly subscription packages. In addition to its subscription fees, Archy serves as a merchant processor for its clients, generating revenue from a percentage of payment transactions processed through the platform.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “This hybrid approach allows us to remain aligned with our clients’ success while providing flexible options that scale with their business needs,” Rat told Crunchbase News.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The company plans to use its new capital to “hire aggressively” across its engineering, AI and go-to-market teams. Presently, it has 57 employees. It plans to expand internationally starting in 2026.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/austin-levitt-97f7&quot;&gt;
     Austin Levitt
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , partner at TCV, told Crunchbase News via email that his firm had been looking for a way to invest in the dental space “for a long time” but didn’t find a company that was “appropriately tackling the root of the problem — the core PMS (practice management systems)” until it came across Archy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    He added: “We consistently heard that Archy was supremely easy to use, requiring almost no training in contrast to others, providing a seamless ‘iPhone-like’ experience, and reducing what took 10 clicks in other software to one or none in Archy.”

  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Regulation As Alpha: Why The Smartest Startups Now Build Legal Strategy Into Their DNA&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Legal.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Every founder knows the thrill of the moment: the first term sheet lands, the product is live, the market is opening up. But in 2025, there’s a new line in the sand:
    &lt;em&gt;
     Did you clear the regulatory path before you scaled?
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Today, it’s not enough to disrupt the market — you have to anticipate the rule-set that will govern it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Investors are shifting gears. After a decade of “move fast and break things,” they’re asking: Who built the compliance engine
    &lt;em&gt;
     before
    &lt;/em&gt;
    the crash? Because the truth is, regulation has become a form of alpha — a competitive advantage for startups that think of law not as a hurdle, but as a moat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The new era of smart compliance
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The startup landscape has changed. High-profile failures — from crypto exchanges to wild valuations in fintech and AI — taught us that the regulatory cost of growth can be massive. Today’s investors and founders alike expect legal strategy from day one, not as an afterthought.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Consider the RegTech market:
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/regulatory-technology-market&quot;&gt;
     One recent estimate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    projects it will swell to about $70.64 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual rate of roughly 23%.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imarcgroup.com/regtech-market&quot;&gt;
     Another forecast
    &lt;/a&gt;
    predicts growth to $70.8 billion by 2033. The message: Companies are no longer asking
    &lt;em&gt;
     if
    &lt;/em&gt;
    they need compliance automation and legal-engineering infrastructure. They’re asking
    &lt;em&gt;
     when
    &lt;/em&gt;
    they can monetize it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So when a startup designs its product around KYC, AML, data-protection or licensing from the outset, it’s not just avoiding risk — it’s building a moat others will struggle to cross. For founders, regulation isn’t just the cost of entry anymore — it’s the cost of exit-edge.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    When the law becomes a moat
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There are former unicorns, and there are
    &lt;em&gt;
     regulation-ready
    &lt;/em&gt;
    unicorns. The difference hinges on when they built their compliance architecture, hired legal engineers and treated regulation as product.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Take payment infrastructure:
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stripe&quot;&gt;
     Stripe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    built
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stripe.com/security&quot;&gt;
     payment-security and licensing into its model early
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , as Stripe’s PCI Level 1 certification and multijurisdiction licenses (U.S. money-transmitter, EU/UK e-money) enabled it to integrate cleanly with
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot;&gt;
     Apple
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Pay, power
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shopify&quot;&gt;
     Shopify
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s native payments, and — per a 2023 announcement — expand its role processing payments for
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amazon&quot;&gt;
     Amazon
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Or look at crypto:
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase&quot;&gt;
     Coinbase
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/en-ca/legal/licenses&quot;&gt;
     built a licensure footprint early
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , publishing its U.S. money-transmitter licenses and securing New York’s BitLicense in 2017. Its 2021 SEC S-1 repeatedly frames regulatory compliance and licensing as fundamental to the business.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In insurtech, from the outset,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lemonade&quot;&gt;
     Lemonade
    &lt;/a&gt;
    hired senior insurance veterans (e.g., former
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-international-group&quot;&gt;
     AIG
    &lt;/a&gt;
    executive
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ty-sagalow&quot;&gt;
     Ty Sagalow
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ) and, per its S-1 and subsequent filings,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ty-sagalow-aigs-former-president-of-product-development-now-lemonades-chief-insurance-officer-564981661.html&quot;&gt;
     expanded licensure across the U.S.
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , operationalizing the 50-state regulatory landscape rather than trying to route around it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    These examples show a pattern: When compliance is built in from the start, the cost of scaling drops and competitors face much higher entry bars. Regulation becomes a moat — not a burden.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The rise of ‘legal engineering’
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Welcome to the era of the legal engineer. The traditional model (sign contract, then lawyer reads, then flagged risk) is being replaced by code, automation and internal teams who speak both product and law.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Startups such as
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eshares&quot;&gt;
     Carta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    built cap-table software that includes “
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.promise.legal/startup-central/carta-cap-tables-for-startups-and-businesses-how-they-work-and-the-essential-role-of-legal-counsel&quot;&gt;
     built-in tools and support to help with compliance year-round
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,” allowing it to embed governance and securities-law readiness into the product nature of equity management.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/plaid&quot;&gt;
     Plaid
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://plaid.com/blog/open-banking-regulation-and-compliance/&quot;&gt;
     has publicly positioned itself for evolving “data use, access, and consumer permission” rules
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (e.g., Section 1033) by building features such as data transparency messaging and consent-capture into its API stack — indicating a clear regulatory-first posture in its product roadmap.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And what’s happening in AI? Founders are hiring general counsels on day one to forecast imminent regimes — privacy law (GDPR, CCPA), AI transparency bills, emerging algorithms-as-infrastructure regulation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The startup battle isn’t simply product vs. product anymore — it’s regulatory architecture vs. regulatory architecture.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Reports back this up: One credible industry estimate shows
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prove.com/blog/regtech-companies-in-us-driving-down-compliance-costs-innovation&quot;&gt;
     the global compliance, governance and risk market is already around $80 billion and projected to reach $120 billion in the next five years
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . In short: Startups that solve compliance at scale are building infrastructure for everyone else to rent. That’s platform-level potential.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Investors are taking note
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Regulation-ready startups aren’t just surviving — they’re attracting smarter capital. Venture funds now assess regulatory maturity, legal runway and governance readiness early on. A startup that can show it isn’t “waiting to deal with compliance” but
    &lt;em&gt;
     designed
    &lt;/em&gt;
    it, has a valuation edge.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Crunchbase data shows
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/state-of-startups-q2-h1-2025-ai-ma-charts-data&quot;&gt;
     global startup funding reached $91 billion in Q2 2025
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , up 11% year over year. While not all of that is focused on law or compliance, the trend signals that smart investors are buried deeper in risk assessment and governance. Legal tech funding is accelerating, too: the sector
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-legal-tech-investment-all-time-high-filevine/&quot;&gt;
     recently topped $2.4 billion in venture funding this year, an all-time high.
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Funds are no longer only assessing TAM or go-to-market speed; they’re asking: “What’s the regulatory runway? Who owns risk? Who built the compliance pipeline?” Because in sectors like fintech, climate tech, health tech and AI, the fastest growth path is often the one that
    &lt;em&gt;
     avoids
    &lt;/em&gt;
    the enforcement arm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The future: law as competitive advantage
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Let’s zoom out for a moment. We’re moving into a world where regulation isn’t a ceiling — it’s scaffolding. It defines markets, enables scaling and filters winners from pretenders. Founders who see law as a source of architecture, not as chewing-gum-on-the-shoe, will be the ones writing the playbook.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Think about AI: Startups that design for regulatory change (data-provenance, audit trails, rights management) are already positioning for the future.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Think about climate tech: Companies that can navigate evolving carbon-credit regimes or ESG disclosure laws are building invisible advantages.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Think about fintech: Those that mastered licensing, KYC/AML, consumer-data flows early are the backbone of infrastructure.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The next wave of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/unicorn-company-list/&quot;&gt;
     unicorns
    &lt;/a&gt;
    won’t just have better tech — they’ll have truly infinitely better legal DNA. They won’t just disrupt a market; they’ll help write the rules of the market before they scale.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Because in this new era, regulation isn’t a deadweight — it’s a launchpad.
   &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    In her new role, Haskaraman will focus on investing in “soon-to-break-out” AI infrastructure, cybersecurity, and applications companies for Felicis, an early-stage firm with $3.9 billion in assets under management.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    During her time at Menlo, Haskaraman sourced and led investments in startups including
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/r2c&quot;&gt;
     Semgrep
    &lt;/a&gt;

    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudtrucks&quot;&gt;
     CloudTrucks
    &lt;/a&gt;
    — zeroing in early on how AI is reshaping developer security and enterprise infrastructure.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Haskaraman, an
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-mit&quot;&gt;
     MIT
    &lt;/a&gt;
    graduate who was born in Turkey, brings an engineering background to her role as an investor. She previously worked as an engineer at various companies at different growth stages, including
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/analog-devices&quot;&gt;
     Analog Devices
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit&quot;&gt;
     Fitbit
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nucleus-9f4a&quot;&gt;
     Nucleus Scientific
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . She is also a former
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mckinsey-company&quot;&gt;
     McKinsey &amp; Co.
    &lt;/a&gt;
    consultant who advised multibillion-dollar technology companies and early-stage startups on strategy and operations. It was after working with startups at McKinsey that her interest in venture capital was piqued, and she joined
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/insight-partners&quot;&gt;
     Insight Partners
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Her decision to join Menlo Park, California-based Felicis stems from a shared interest alongside firm founder and managing partner
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aydin-senkut&quot;&gt;
     Aydin Senkut
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to build communities even in “unsexy” industries such as infrastructure and security, she said.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “Whether it’s connecting AI founders or bringing together technical and cybersecurity communities, the mission is the same: Believe in the best founders early and help them go the distance,” she told Crunchbase News.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Felicis is currently investing out of its 10th fund, a $900 million vehicle, its largest yet. More than 60% of its investments out of Fund 9 and 10 (so far) are seed stage; 94% are seed or Series A. In 83% of its investments, Felicis has led or co-led the round.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nearly $3 out of every $4 that it’s deployed have gone into AI-related companies, including

    In an interview, Haskaraman shared more about her investment plans at Felicis, as well as why she thinks we’re in the “early innings” with AI. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Let’s talk more about community-building and why you think it’s so important.
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Over the past few years in the venture ecosystem, just providing the capital is not enough. You need to surround yourself with the best talent. You’re seeing one of the fiercest talent wars in terms of AI talent.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So one of the things that I’ve spent a lot of time on in my VC career is building a community, going back to my MIT roots, surrounding myself with founders, engineers and operators, and also going into specific domains, like cybersecurity — just building a network of CISOs that I communicate with regularly and really support them however I can, and then obviously get their take on the latest technology.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That type of community-building effort is something that Aydin and I will be debating strategy for Felicis as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Yes, Aydin (Felicis’ founder) has said that he thinks the next generation of enterprise investors aren’t just picking companies, they’re building ecosystems. Would you agree with that?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yes, we’re fully aligned on that. First of all, it’s a way of sourcing. Being able to source the best founders involves surrounding yourself in a community of people. You get very close to them, and you want to be the first call when they decide to jump ship and start a business.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As early-connection investors, we want to invest in the founders as early as possible. So that’s why we want to immerse ourselves in these communities that provide prolific grounds for the technical founders that are coming in and building an AI.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     You were investing in AI before the big boom took off. Would you say there’s too much hype around the space?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You are correct that there is a lot of euphoria around AI, but if you look at the overall landscape, we haven’t seen a technology that can have such a large impact.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And we’re already seeing the results in enterprises that buyers of these solutions, and consumers of these solutions, including myself and our team, are seeing immense amounts of productivity gains. I remain immensely optimistic about the future and investing in AI, and that’s what we are paid to do, and what I also enjoy as a former engineer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Are there specific aspects of AI that have you particularly excited?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I personally feel we’re still very much at the early innings. It’s been three years since ChatGPT came out, and the model companies really pushed their products into our lives. But if you take a look at what’s happening now, we have agents that are coordinating and automating our work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What are ways in which we should be securing agent architecture? And that is also evolving across the board, and if you think about another layer down, like the infrastructure to support these LLMs and agents, I have to ask “What do we need underneath?”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I think there’s a lot more that will come, and there’s a lot of hope for innovation that will happen both across the infrastructure layer, as well as agents. There’s also the issue of “can applications actually be enabled?” I go back to the importance of securing our interactions with the agents and making sure that they’re not abused and misused. It’s a great time to be investing in AI.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     What stages are you primarily investing in at Felicis?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We try to go as early as possible. But obviously, given our fund’s size, we have flexibility to invest whenever we see the venture scale returns make sense. But the majority of our investments are seed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     It’s such a competitive investing environment right now. How do you stand out?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Ultimately, what founders value is how you will work with them, your references. They value how you show up in those tough times, how you surround them with talent, how you help them see around the corners. That matters a lot.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I believe that winning boils down to the prior founder experiences that you left, people who can speak highly of you and how you work. I tend to be a big hustler. So, there’s a lot more value-add that we want to make sure we bring to the table, even before investments. And then after the investment we can continue to bring that type of value to a company.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Are you investing outside of AI?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m investing in AI infrastructure, cybersecurity and AI-enabled apps. We are also at the verge of a big overhaul in terms of the application layer, companies that we’ve seen prior to AI — that is all getting disrupted.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’re seeing AI scribes in healthcare intake solutions, for example. We’re seeing code-generation solutions in developer stacks. We are looking at every single vertical, as well as horizontal application. I’m very interested in how all of these verticals’ application layers will get a different type of automation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     What’s your take on the market overall right now?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I feel like I lived three lifetimes in my investing career — just over the past few years. We as a VC community and tech ecosystem learned a lot, obviously, just in terms of what’s happening. We’re seeing new ingredients in the market, and that is AI, that did not exist during COVID.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Think about the fact that this is not a structural change in the market driven by the economy. This is truly a new technology. I would bucket those waves as separate.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’m very grateful to be investing at this time. What a time to be investing, because AI is truly game-changing as a technology.

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;The State Of Startups In 7 Charts: These Sectors And Stages Are Down As AI Megarounds Dominate In 2025&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Quarterly-agenticAI.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Venture funding has most definitely rebounded since the 2022 correction, but there’s a sharp divide between who’s getting funding and who’s not.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That was the overarching theme from our third-quarter market reports, which showed that
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-funding-biggest-deals-q3-2025-ai-ma-data/&quot;&gt;
     global startup funding in Q3
    &lt;/a&gt;
    totaled $97 billion, marking only the fourth quarter above $90 billion since Q3 2022.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, there are stark differences between the 2021 market peak and now, as contributing reporter
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/author/joanna/&quot;&gt;
     Joanna Glasner
    &lt;/a&gt;
    noted in a couple of recent columns,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/2021-2025-market-comparison-valuations-ai-startups/&quot;&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/2021-2025-market-peak-differences-ai/&quot;&gt;
     here
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Just as we saw
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/business/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/&quot;&gt;
     four years ago
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , funding is frothy and often seems to be driven by investor FOMO. Some companies are even
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/fastest-companies-seriesa-to-seriesc-ai-fintech-spacetech/&quot;&gt;
     raising follow-on rounds at head-spinning speeds
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But the funding surge this time is also much, much more concentrated — namely in outsized rounds for AI companies.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With that, let’s take a look at the charts that illustrate the major private-market and startup funding themes as we head into the final quarter of 2025.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    AI funding continues to drive venture growth
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nearly half — 46% — of startup funding globally in Q3 went to AI companies, Crunchbase data shows. Almost a third went to a single company:
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic&quot;&gt;
     Anthropic
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which raised $13 billion last quarter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even with an astonishing $45 billion going to artificial intelligence startups in Q3, it was only the third-highest quarter on record for AI funding, with Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 each clocking in higher.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/bda49763-88e1-416c-b519-fb91b4fb9c81?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Global Funding To AI, By Quarter&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Megarounds gobble up lion’s share
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that AI has also skewed investment heavily toward
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/biggest-us-vc-startup-funding-deals-2023/&quot;&gt;
     megarounds
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which we define as funding deals of $100 million or more.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The percentage of overall funding going into such deals
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/funding-megarounds-unicorns-ai-share-of-capital-data/&quot;&gt;
     hit a record high this year
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , with an astonishing 60% of global and 70% of U.S. venture capital going to $100 million-plus rounds, per Crunchbase data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even with several months left in the year, it also seems plausible that the total dollars going into such deals will match or top what we saw in 2021, which marked a peak for startup funding not scaled before or since.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The difference? Back then, startup dollars were widely distributed, going to a whole host of sectors — from food tech to health tech to robotics — and to early-stage, late-stage and in-between companies alike.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Contrast that with recent quarters, when the LLM giants and other large, established, AI-centric companies are
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/big-dollar-ai-investors-2025-softbank/&quot;&gt;
     getting the largest slice of venture dollars
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/1c8a21d7-0078-49fb-a618-69672990d48a?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Share Of US Startup Funding Going To $100M+ Rounds&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Seed deals slide further
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As megarounds have increased, seed deals have declined.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The number of seed deals has shown a steady downward trend in recent quarters, Crunchbase data shows, even as total dollars invested at the stage has stayed relatively steady. That indicates that while seed deals are growing larger, they’re also harder to come by.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/05f14caf-b691-408f-a554-8674df6d8a9d?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Global Seed Funding Q3-2025&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Early-stage funding has essentially flatlined, despite larger rounds to companies working on robotics, biotech, AI and other technologies.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/33b2c2e7-f97a-47f9-b681-224011a623e1?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Global Early Venture Funding Q3-2025&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The AI haves and have-nots
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    AI has enthralled investors for the past three years.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What are they less interested in? Old standbys like cybersecurity and biotech.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/biotech-us-funding-share-lowest-2025/&quot;&gt;
     Biotech investment as a share of overall funding recently hit a 20-year low
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Crunchbase data shows that cybersecurity investment, while still relatively steady, also
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/cybersecurity-startup-funding-dropped-q3-2025/&quot;&gt;
     retreated somewhat in Q3 2025
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . That’s notable given that many cybersecurity companies are integrating AI into their offerings.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/ac24f84e-1438-48fd-bfdd-a3d21c3f567c?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Global Cybersecurity Startup Funding-10/17/2025&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, other sectors that benefit heavily from AI-driven automation are seeing a surge in investment. Perhaps most notable is legal tech,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-legal-tech-investment-all-time-high-filevine/&quot;&gt;
     which hit an all-time high last month
    &lt;/a&gt;
    on the back of large rounds for companies promising to automate much of the drudgery of the profession.
   &lt;/p&gt;

     across more than 1,000 deals in Q3, flat quarter over quarter but up 22% year over year. Early-stage investment was particularly strong, and the region benefited from the excitement around

     Are we in a bubble?
    &lt;/a&gt;
    And given that nearly half of venture capital in recent years has been tied up in AI, what happens to the startup ecosystem if or when it pops?

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     By
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/yakov-filippenko&quot;&gt;
      Yakov Filippenko
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    No founder plans for the day they get fired from their own company.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You plan for funding rounds, product launches and exits, but not for the boardroom moment when everyone raises their hand, and you realize your journey inside the company is over.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It happened to me. I called that board meeting. I set the vote. We had to choose who would stay, me or my co-founder. The vote didn’t go my way.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In movies, this is where the music swells and the credits roll.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-jobs-07cd&quot;&gt;
     Steve Jobs
    &lt;/a&gt;
    after
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-sculley-iii&quot;&gt;
     John Sculley
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/travis-kalanick&quot;&gt;
     Travis Kalanick
    &lt;/a&gt;
    after
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/bill-gurley&quot;&gt;
     Bill Gurley
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . In real life, there’s no cinematic pause. No final scene. Just the quiet realization that everything you built now belongs to someone else.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What follows isn’t drama, either. It’s disorientation. And like most founders, I had no idea how to handle it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Don’t fill the silence too fast
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When it ended, I filled my calendar with aimless meetings. Five or six a day. Not because they had any real purpose, but because it felt strange not to be doing business. For more than 10 years, I’d never had a day when I didn’t have to think about work. A startup teaches you to fix things fast.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When you’re out, though, there’s nothing left to fix. Only yourself. Getting pushed out isn’t like missing a quarterly target. It’s like losing the story you’ve been telling yourself for years.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The hardest part is that you don’t know who to blame.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Investors? They were doing their job. Yourself? Every decision made sense in context. So the frustration lands on the person closest to you. Your co-founder. It’s not about logic. I would say it is more of a defense mechanism. It’s how the mind tries to make sense of loss.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Learn to see the pattern
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For months, I kept asking: What did we do wrong? It took me a couple of years to see the pattern.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Later, working inside a venture fund helped me see the truth. I saw the same story play out again and again. Founders repeating the same emotional arc, as follows:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Expectation of an M&amp;A deal;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Long wait for the deal;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     The deal collapses;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     The startup stalls;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Expectations diverge; and then
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Resentment between co-founders
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Every time, the same sequence. And when the dream fades, blame fills the gap.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The pattern itself is that the anger toward a co-founder is often a projection of disappointment from a failed deal. If that energy isn’t processed consciously, it finds its own way out, usually as anger. You can’t really be mad at yourself; you did everything right. The other side acted in their own interest. So it lands on the person next to you, your co-founder and your team, and for them, it’s you.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And that’s where I have a bit of a claim toward investors because they often see this dynamic coming and could at least warn founders about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Once I recognized the pattern, I stopped seeing my story as a failure. It was part of a cycle almost every founder goes through, only most don’t talk about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Trade strategy for emotional tools
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Traditional business tools didn’t help. OKRs, planning sessions, strategy off-sites, none of it worked on the inner collapse that comes when your identity and your company split apart.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This led me to begin studying
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/gestalt-therapy&quot;&gt;
     Gestalt therapy
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . It gave me the language to understand how situations like this actually work, their cycles, causes and effects, and how to think about them with the right awareness and perspective. One part of building startups isn’t about pivots or fundraising. It’s realizing how much of yourself you’ve tied to the story you’re telling the world.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The point is to first get conscious of your anger, and then let it out.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Acceptance comes in stages
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Acceptance doesn’t show up all at once. It arrives in pieces.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For me, the first piece came when I watched another founder go through the same breakdown and recognized every stage.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The second came when my first startup was acquired. Not at the valuation I’d dreamed of, but enough to accept that it continued without me. The third came with my current company,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intch&quot;&gt;
     Intch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is built from calm, not from fear.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I no longer measure success by control, but by clarity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    What I’d tell a founder in that room
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here’s what I’d share now with another entrepreneur who finds themselves in the same situation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     You’re losing a story, not your worth. Give yourself space to grieve it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Don’t let anger choose a target. Name the pattern instead.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Find mirrors. Other founders are walking through the same steps.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Business tools have limits. Emotional tools matter here.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Acceptance comes in stages. You’ll recognize them when they arrive.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Founders are trained to manage everything except their own psychology. But startups are way more than capital and code. They run on the emotional architecture of the people who build them. And when that structure breaks, rebuilding it is the most important startup you’ll ever work on.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;hr/&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/yakov-filippenko&quot;&gt;
      Yakov Filippenko
     &lt;/a&gt;
     is a seasoned entrepreneur with more than 10 years of experience in IT and technologies, as well as scaling businesses internationally. As a product manager at
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yandex-acdf&quot;&gt;
      Yandex
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , he led a team that grew the product’s user base from 500,000 to 1.2 million and secured its entry into the international market. Subsequently, he co-founded
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sailplay&quot;&gt;
      SailPlay
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , which he scaled to 45 countries and eventually exited, after it was acquired by
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/retail-rocket&quot;&gt;
      Retail Rocket
     &lt;/a&gt;
     in 2018. In 2021, Filippenko launched
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intch&quot;&gt;
      Intch
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , an AI-powered platform connecting part-time professionals with flexible roles.

    Funding to e-commerce startups globally so far this year totals $7.1 billion, per Crunchbase
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/saved/funding-to-e-commerce-startups-2025/a9b2cada-24a3-4dcf-a199-fe4b6612cd12&quot;&gt;
     data
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . That compares to $11.3 billion raised by e-commerce startups globally in all of 2024. This year’s numbers are also down significantly from post-pandemic funding totals, which surged to $93 billion in 2021.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    ‘Retail’s new normal’
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Live commerce is the combination of livestreaming and online shopping.

     Grant LaFontaine
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , co-founder and CEO of Whatnot, said in an announcement that his startup is “proving that live shopping is retail’s new normal.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The company says more than $6 billion worth of items have been sold on its platform in 2025 so far, more than twice its total for all of 2024. Its app facilitates the buying and selling of collectibles like trading cards and toys through live video auctions. It also offers items such as clothing and sneakers. It competes with the likes of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ebay&quot;&gt;
     eBay
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which currently does not offer a livestreaming option. It’s also a competitor to
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok&quot;&gt;
     TikTok
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Shop.
   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     By
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeff-seibert&quot;&gt;
      Jeff Seibert
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I’ve been building products and companies my entire career —
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/increo&quot;&gt;
     Increo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/box&quot;&gt;
     Box
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crashlytics&quot;&gt;
     Crashlytics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/twitter&quot;&gt;
     Twitter
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and now,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/digits&quot;&gt;
     Digits
    &lt;/a&gt;
    — and I’ve had the privilege of speaking with some of the sharpest minds in venture and entrepreneurship along the way.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One recent conversation with a legendary investor really crystallized for me a set of truths about startups: what success really is, why some founders thrive while others burn out, and how to navigate the inevitable chaos of building something from nothing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here are some of the lessons I’ve internalized from years of building, observing and learning.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Success has no finish line
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In the startup world, we talk a lot about IPOs, acquisitions and valuations. But those are milestones, not destinations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The companies that endure don’t “win” and stop — they keep creating, adapting and pushing forward. They’re playing an infinite game, where the only goal is to remain in the game.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When you’re building something truly generative — driven by a purpose greater than yourself — there’s no point at which you can say “done.” If your company has a natural stopping point, you may be building the wrong thing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    You don’t choose the work — the work chooses you
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The best founders I’ve met — and the best moments I’ve had as a founder — come from an almost irrational pull toward solving a specific problem I myself experienced.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    You may want to start a company, but if you have to talk yourself into your idea, it probably won’t survive contact with reality. The founders who succeed are often the ones who can’t
    &lt;em&gt;
     not
    &lt;/em&gt;
    work on their thing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Starting a company shouldn’t be a career move — it should be the last possible option after every other path fails to scratch the itch.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The real killer: founder fatigue
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Most companies don’t die because of one bad decision or one tough competitor. They die because the founders run out of energy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Fatigue erodes vision, motivation and creativity. Protecting your own drive — keeping it clean and focused — may be the single most important survival skill you have.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That means staying close to the product, protecting time for customer work, and avoiding the slow drift into managing around problems instead of solving them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Customer &amp;gt; competitor
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s easy to get caught up in competitor moves, investor chatter or market gossip. But the most important question is always: Are we delivering joy to the customer?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you’re losing focus, sign up for your own product as a brand-new user. Feel the friction. Fix it. Repeat.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At Digits, we run our own signup and core flows every week. It’s uncomfortable — it surfaces flaws we’d rather not see — but it keeps us anchored to the only metric that matters: customer delight.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Boards should ask questions, not give answers
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Over the years, I’ve learned the most effective boards aren’t presentation theaters — they’re discussion rooms.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The best structure I’ve seen:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     No slides;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     A narrative pre-read sent in advance; and
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     A deep dive into one essential question.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Good directors help you widen your perspective. They don’t hand you a to-do list. Rather, they help you see the problem in a way that makes the answer obvious.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Twitter: lessons from a phenomenon
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When I think back to my time at Twitter, the most enduring lesson is that not all companies are built top-down. Some — like Twitter — are shaped more by their users than their executives.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Features like @mentions, hashtags and retweets didn’t come from a product roadmap — they came from the community.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s messy, but it’s also powerful. Sometimes your job isn’t to control the phenomenon, rather it’s to keep it healthy without smothering what made it magical in the first place.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Why now is a great time to start
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you’re building today, you have an advantage over the so-called “unicorn zombies” that raised massive rounds pre-AI and are now locked into defending old business models.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Fresh founders can design from scratch for the new reality; there’s no legacy to protect, no sacred cows to defend.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The macro environment? Irrelevant. The only timing that matters is when the problem calls you so strongly that not working on it feels impossible.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If there’s one takeaway from all of this, it’s that success is continuing. The real prize is the ability to keep playing, keep serving and keep creating.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If you’re standing at the edge, wondering if you should start — start. Take one step. See if it grows. And if it does, welcome to the infinite game.
   &lt;/p&gt;

<title> Crunchbase Sector Snapshot: Cleantech Isn’t Having A Great Year </title>

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Crunchbase Sector Snapshot: Cleantech Isn’t Having A Great Year&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Clean_Tech.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    While startup investment has been
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-funding-biggest-deals-q3-2025-ai-ma-data/&quot;&gt;
     climbing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    lately, not all industries are partaking in the gains.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Cleantech is one of the spaces that’s been mostly left out. Overall funding to the space is down this year, despite some pockets of bullishness in areas like fusion and battery recycling.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     The broad trend:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Cleantech- and sustainability-related startup investment has been on a downward trajectory for several years now. And so far, 2025 is on track to be another down year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the bright side, however, there’s been some pickup in recent months, boosted by big rounds for companies in energy storage, fusion and other cleantech subsectors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     The numbers:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
    Investors put an estimated $20 billion into seed- through growth-stage funding to companies in cleantech, EV and sustainability-related categories so far this year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That puts 2025 funding on track to come in well below last year’s levels, which were already at a multiyear low.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, quarter by quarter, the pattern looks more encouraging. Investment hit a low point in Q1 of this year and recovered some in the subsequent two quarters. The current quarter is also off to a strong start.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/4f9fdef1-6885-43bb-9a24-e44c26192bd7?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Copy: Annual Cleantech-, EV- And Sustainability-Related Funding-10/28/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Noteworthy recent rounds
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The largest cleantech-related round of the year closed this month.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/base-power&quot;&gt;
     Base Power
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a provider of residential battery backup systems and electricity plans, raised $1 billion in Series C funding. The Austin, Texas-based company says its systems allow energy providers to more efficiently harness renewable power.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The second-largest round was
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/commonwealth-fusion-systems&quot;&gt;
     Commonwealth Fusion Systems
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’ $863 million Series B2 financing. The Devens, Massachusetts-based company says it is moving closer to being the first in the world to commercialize fusion power.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For a bigger-picture view, below we put together a list of 10 of the year’s largest cleantech- and sustainability-related financings.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/8311b6a6-cced-4480-9b3d-8c1ea93e9367?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Large 2025 Financings For Cleantech, EV And Sustainability Startups-10/28/25&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     The broad takeaway: Startups innovating for an era of rising power consumption
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Not to over-generalize, but if there was one big takeaway from recent cleantech and sustainability startup funding, it would be that founders and investors recognize that these are times of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-energy-demand-surged-in-2024-to-almost-twice-its-recent-average?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot;&gt;
     ever-escalating energy demand.
    &lt;/a&gt;
    They’re planning accordingly, looking to tap new sources of power, fusion in particular, as well as better utilize and scale existing clean energy sources.

  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Sure, Valuations Look High. But Here’s How Today Is Different From The Last Peak&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/huge-valuations.jpg&quot;/&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
    Correctly calling a market peak is a notoriously tricky endeavor.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Case in point: When tech stocks and startup funding hit their last cyclical peak four years ago, few knew it was the optimal time to cease new deals and cash in liquidatable holdings.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This time around, quite a few market watchers are
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-bubble-debate-price-value-risk-gray-equidam/&quot;&gt;
     wondering
    &lt;/a&gt;
    if the tech stock and AI boom has reached bubble territory. And, as we explored in
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/2021-2025-market-comparison-valuations-ai-startups/&quot;&gt;
     Friday’s column
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , there are plenty of similarities between current conditions and the 2021 peak.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even so, by other measures we’re also in starkly different territory. The current boom is far more concentrated in AI and a handful of hot companies. The exit environment is also much quieter. And of course, the macro conditions don’t resemble 2021, which had the combined economic effects of the COVID pandemic and historically low interest rates.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Below, we look at four of the top reasons why this time is different.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 1: Funding is largely going into AI, while other areas aren’t seeing a boom
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Four years ago, funding to most venture-backed sectors was sharply on the rise. That’s not the case this time around.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/funding-megarounds-unicorns-ai-share-of-capital-data/&quot;&gt;
     While AI megarounds accumulate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , funding to startups in myriad other sectors continues to languish.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Biotech is
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/biotech-us-funding-share-lowest-2025/&quot;&gt;
     on track
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to capture the smallest percentage of U.S. venture investment on record this year. Cleantech investment looks
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/clean-tech-and-energy/sustainability-funding-falling-2025/&quot;&gt;
     poised
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to hit a multiyear low. And consumer products startups also remain out of vogue, alongside quite a few other sectors that once attracted big venture checks.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The emergence of AI haves and non-AI have-nots means that if we do see a correction, it could be limited in scope. Sectors that haven’t seen a boom by definition won’t see a post-boom crash. (Though further declines are possible.)
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 2: The IPO market is not on fire
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/public/heres-whos-gone-public-in-2021-so-far/&quot;&gt;
     The new offering market was on fire in 2020 and 2021
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , with traditional IPOs, direct listings and SPAC mergers all flooding exchanges with new ticker symbols to track.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In recent quarters, by contrast, the IPO market has been alive, but not especially lively. We’ve seen a few large offerings, with
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coreweave&quot;&gt;
     CoreWeave
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/figma&quot;&gt;
     Figma
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/circle-2&quot;&gt;
     Circle
    &lt;/a&gt;
    among the standouts.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But overall, numbers are way down.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In 2021, there were hundreds of U.S. seed or venture-backed companies that
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/saved/nyse-and-nasdaq-debuts-of-funded/03b9fe73-8f69-4d6d-8099-fbcffc243dc2&quot;&gt;
     debuted
    &lt;/a&gt;
    on
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/new-york-stock-exchange&quot;&gt;
     NYSE
    &lt;/a&gt;
    or
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq&quot;&gt;
     Nasdaq
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , per Crunchbase data. This year, there have been less than 50.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Meanwhile, the most prominent unicorns of the AI era, like
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai&quot;&gt;
     OpenAI
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic&quot;&gt;
     Anthropic
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , remain private companies with no buzz about an imminent IPO. As such, they don’t see the day-to-day fluctuations typical of public companies. Any drop in valuation, if it happens, could play out slowly and quietly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 3: Funding is concentrated among fewer companies
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That brings us to our next point: In addition to spreading their largesse across fewer sectors, startup investors are also backing fewer companies.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year, the percentage of startup funding going to megarounds of $100 million or more reached an
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/funding-megarounds-unicorns-ai-share-of-capital-data/&quot;&gt;
     all-time high
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in the U.S. and came close to a record global level. A single deal, OpenAI’s
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/softbank-openai-historic-startup-financing-ai-unicorn/&quot;&gt;
     $40 billion March financing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , accounted for roughly a quarter of  U.S. megaround funding.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the same time, fewer startup financings are getting done. This past quarter, for instance, reported deal count hit the lowest level in years, even as investment rose.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 4: ZIRP era is long gone
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The last peak occurred amid an unusual financial backdrop, with economies beginning to emerge from the depths of the COVID pandemic and ultra-low interest rates contributing to investors shouldering more risk in pursuit of returns.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This time around, the macro environment is in a far different place, with “a “
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/23/fed-chair-powell-its-a-low-fire-low-hire-economy.html&quot;&gt;
     low fire, low hire
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ” U.S. job market, AI disrupting or poised to disrupt a wide array of industries and occupations, a weaker dollar and a long list of other unusual drivers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What both periods share in common, however, is the inexorable climb of big tech valuations, which brings us to our final thought.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Actually, maybe the similarities do exceed differences
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    While the argument that this time it’s different is a familiar one, the usual plot lines do tend to repeat themselves. Valuations overshoot, and they come down. And then the cycle repeats.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We may not have reached the top of the current cycle. But it’s certainly looking a lot closer to peak than trough.

<title> How To Found A Startup Inside A Scale-Up </title>

  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;How To Found A Startup Inside A Scale-Up&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Start_Up_Watch.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     By
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vykintas-maknickas&quot;&gt;
      Vykintas Maknickas
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The old cliché says startups are born in garages and dorm rooms. That’s still true, but there’s a newer path: founding a startup inside a scale-up.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When you do that, you get the speed of a seed-stage team with the leverage of an established company. Executives and investors should care because this model can unlock new product lines, revenue and talent retention without recreating the wheel.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s how we built
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/saily-42b3&quot;&gt;
     Saily
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a travel eSIM service launched from inside
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nord-security&quot;&gt;
     Nord Security
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (the company behind
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nordvpn&quot;&gt;
     NordVPN
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ). In 19 weeks, a seven-person team went from a blank page to a live product. A little over a year later, we had scaled to millions of users with plans offered in more than 200 destinations. We did not invent everything from scratch. We reused what worked and validated everything else fast.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Incubation lowers two risks most founders underestimate
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Every new product faces two existential risks: market and execution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Inside Nord, I’d helped launch at least half a dozen new products before Saily. The pattern was consistent: Great ideas die when they target the wrong market or underestimate execution. With Saily, timing and infrastructure lined up: eSIM demand was accelerating, pain points were clear, and we could tap Nord’s backend, payments, app teams and distribution.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That allowed us to move at startup speed without startup fragility.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    ‘Product organization fit’ beats a great idea
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Founders obsess over product-market fit. Inside a scale-up, you also need what I call “product organization fit” or the overlap between a new product and what your company already does well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When that overlap is high, you ship faster, hire smarter and avoid costly relearning. For Saily, the overlap was obvious: Security tech we knew (virtual location, web protection and ad-blocking), and app development know-how we could bring to travel connectivity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Competition helped more than it hurt. “No competition” usually means “no demand.” We treated competitors as free market research, reading hiring signals, product moves and funding announcements to understand where the market was headed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And we made security the product, not a feature. Travelers don’t want another app — they want reliable connectivity that isn’t risky on unknown networks. Building privacy and protection at the network layer means safety works phone-wide with no tinkering.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Autonomy inside structure
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The hard part is not technical, but cultural. Large companies run on process. Startups run on autonomy. We set up Saily as a company within the company: A dedicated product and marketing team with decision speed, plus shared services (legal, finance and design) when needed. Think of it as an internal accelerator, where the platform handles overheads so the team can focus on products.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We kept one rhythm: ship, learn, repeat. Those 19 weeks weren’t about perfection, but about getting a usable product into the world and compounding feedback.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Experimentation only works if you measure what matters: speed, unit economics and retention. For example, independent third-party testing confirmed Saily’s network-level ad-blocking reduces data usage by 28.6% — real money saved for travelers. That is a signal you double down on. If a feature or tool adds complexity without value, cut it quickly.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    What founders (and operators) can steal
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Derisk in two tracks:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Validate market pull and execution feasibility before you scale spend. If the market isn’t growing and your organization doesn’t have overlap, think twice.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Reuse before you reinvent:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Borrow talent, systems and channels where you can. Every overlap removes weeks of risk.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Measure what matters:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Do a simple before/after on ship speed, customer acquisition cost and retention. If the needle doesn’t move, remove it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Build momentum in full sight:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Share milestones and learning. It sharpens the team and attracts partners.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Saily is still early, and the market is just getting started, but the model matters as much as the product. Many future founders already work inside growth companies. Give them startup autonomy and scale-up leverage and remarkable things can happen — in months, not years.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;hr/&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;

<title> A Look At Coinbase’s Ongoing Shopping Spree </title>

  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;A Look At Coinbase’s Ongoing Shopping Spree&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Coinbase.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase&quot;&gt;
     Coinbase
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has been on a buying spree.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On Oct. 21, the publicly traded crypto exchange announced that it is
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-coinbase-375m-echo-acquisition-120906419.html&quot;&gt;
     acquiring
    &lt;/a&gt;
    early-stage investing platform
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/echo-d596&quot;&gt;
     Echo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for $375 million in cash and equity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Notably, the acquisition marked the eighth buy for the San Francisco-based company in 2025 so far, according to
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/finance/coinbase-strikes-deal-for-crypto-investing-platform-echo-86954fd5?mod=e2fb&quot;&gt;
     The Wall Street Journal
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Of those eight deals, three involved undisclosed businesses.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Overall, since its 2012 inception, Coinbase has acquired dozens of companies, per Crunchbase
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/saved/coinbase-acquisitions-2012-to-date/0cbfbb74-2142-4d17-bfe3-3fb51c1bc51f&quot;&gt;
     data
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Besides Echo, it announced purchases of the following startups in 2025:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     In January, it acquired
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stryk-by-bux&quot;&gt;
      Stryk
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , the Cyprus-based unit of
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bux&quot;&gt;
      BUX
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , as part of a European expansion. Stryk offers CFD trading services to European residents through an app. Financial terms were not disclosed
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Also in January, Coinbase picked up
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spindl&quot;&gt;
      Spindl
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , a 3-year-old San Francisco-based startup that developed a blockchain-based attribution system to help businesses accelerate user growth.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     In May, it acquired
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deribit&quot;&gt;
      Deribit
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , a 10-year-old cryptocurrency derivatives exchange offering options, futures and spot trading for digital assets based in the Netherlands.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Then in July, Coinbase acquired
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/liquifi-d09f&quot;&gt;
      Liquifi
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , a 4-year-old San Francisco-based startup that helps crypto companies automate their token vesting and lockups, and manage their token cap table. Liquifi was a self-described “Carta for crypto.”
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     Now it has announced plans to buy
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/echo-d596&quot;&gt;
      Echo
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , an onchain digital platform that helps communities invest together and aims to give founders more options for their cap table.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Coinbase’s buying sprees seem to come in spurts, according to the data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Crypto’s crash and recovery
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For example, in 2018, it acquired eight known companies. And then in 2021, it picked up seven known companies. But most years, it acquired only one or two companies.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Interestingly, 2018 was defined by what has been described as the “Great Crypto Crash,” or a massive market sell-off after the boom that took place in 2017. Things had rebounded by 2021, which saw a bull market for crypto and the rise of NFTs and DeFi. That November, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,000.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After a bumpy few years, which saw the arrests of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-exchange&quot;&gt;
     FTX
    &lt;/a&gt;
    founder
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sam-bankman-fried&quot;&gt;
     Sam Bankman-Fried
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/binance&quot;&gt;
     Binance
    &lt;/a&gt;
    CEO and founder
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/changpeng-zhao&quot;&gt;
     Changpeng Zhao
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , Bitcoin has rebounded, surging to an all-time high in 2025. Prices reached $113,156.57 on Oct. 15.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In announcing its plan to acquire Echo, Coinbase
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-acquires-echo-unlocking-the-future-of-onchain-capital-formation&quot;&gt;
     said
    &lt;/a&gt;
    the two companies shared a similar mission of “democratizing early-stage investing, so that more people can support the next generation of breakthrough companies.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The buy complemented its earlier acquisition of Liquifi, Coinbase said, noting that: “While Liquifi strengthened our ability to support builders at the start of their journey, Echo extends that support into fundraising.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The largest of its acquisitions in 2025 so far, though, was its $2.9 billion buy of Deribit.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Meanwhile, Coinbase’s market cap as of Oct. 23 hovered just under $83 billion, while its stock is up over 25% year to date.
   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;The Last Market Boom Ended 4 Years Ago. Here’s How Current Conditions Look Similar&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Rise_Of_Massive_Funding.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nearly four years ago, the market hit a cyclical peak under conditions that in many ways look quite similar to what we’re seeing today.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sky-high public tech valuations.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/business/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/&quot;&gt;
     Booming startup investment
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Sharply rising valuations. And, a few cracks emerging on the new offering front.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Sure, there are quite a few differences in the investment environment, which we’ll explore in a follow-on piece. For this first installment, however, we are focusing on the commonalities, with an eye to the four highlighted above.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 1: Sky-high public tech valuations
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    First, both then and now, tech stocks hit unprecedented highs.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In mid-November 2021, the tech-heavy
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=nasdaq+composite&amp;oq=nasdaq+composite&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyGQgAEEUYORhDGEYYgwEY-gEYsQMYgAQYigUyBggBECMYJzITCAIQABiDARiRAhixAxiABBiKBTITCAMQABiDARiRAhixAxiABBiKBTISCAQQABgUGIMBGIcCGLEDGIAEMg0IBRAAGJECGIAEGIoFMgwIBhAAGBQYhwIYgAQyDQgHEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyDQgIEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQk0MTE1ajBqMTWoAgiwAgHxBbscasdmn8rr&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;
     Nasdaq Composite
    &lt;/a&gt;
    index hit an all-time peak above 16,000. Gains stemmed largely from sharply rising tech share prices.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Today, the
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nasdaq&quot;&gt;
     Nasdaq
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is hovering not far below a new all-time high of over 23,000. The five most valuable tech companies have a
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://companiesmarketcap.com&quot;&gt;
     collective market cap
    &lt;/a&gt;
    of more than $16 trillion. Other hot companies, like
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amd&quot;&gt;
     AMD
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/palantir-technologies&quot;&gt;
     Palantir Technologies
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/broadcom&quot;&gt;
     Broadcom
    &lt;/a&gt;
    have soared to record heights this year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    While private startups don’t see day-to-day valuation gyrations like publicly traded companies, their investors do take cues from public markets. When public-market bullishness subsides, private up rounds tend to diminish as well.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 2: Booming startup investment
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In late 2021, just like today, venture investment was going strong.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last time, admittedly, it was much stronger. Global startup funding
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/business/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/&quot;&gt;
     shattered all records
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in 2021, with more than $640 billion invested. That was nearly double year-earlier levels. Funding surged to a broad swathe of startup sectors, with fintech in particular leading the gains.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For the first three quarters of this year, by contrast, global investment totaled a more modest $303 billion. However, that’s still on track for the highest tally in years. The core driver is, of course, voracious investor appetite for AI leaders, evidenced by
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai&quot;&gt;
     OpenAI
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s record-setting
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-strong-q1-2025-ai-data/&quot;&gt;
     $40 billion financing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in March.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The pace of unicorn creation is also
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/unicorn-board-count-soars-september-2025-nscale-filevine/&quot;&gt;
     picking up
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which brings us to our next similarity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 3: Up rounds and sharply rising valuations
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At the last market peak, valuations for hot startups soared, driven in large part by heated competition among startup investors to get into pre-IPO rounds.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This time around, we’re also seeing sought-after startups raising follow-on rounds in quick succession, commonly at sharply escalated valuations. Per Crunchbase data, dozens of companies have
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/fastest-companies-seriesa-to-seriesc-ai-fintech-spacetech/&quot;&gt;
     scaled from Series A to Series C
    &lt;/a&gt;
    within just a couple of years, including several that took less than 12 months.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’re also seeing prominent unicorns
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/unicorns-raising-rounds-quickly-ai-defense-fintech/&quot;&gt;
     raising follow-on rounds at a rapid pace
    &lt;/a&gt;
    this year. Standouts include generative AI giants as well as hot startups in vertical AI, cybersecurity and defense tech.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    No. 4: A few cracks emerging
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    During the 2021 market peak, even when the overall investment climate was buzzier than ever, we did see some worrisome developments and areas of declining valuations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For that period, one of the earlier indicators was share-price deterioration for many of the initial companies to go public via SPAC. By late 2021, it had become clear that there were numerous “
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/public/vc-backed-startups-spac-worst-performing-2021/&quot;&gt;
     truly terrible performers
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ” among the cohort, including well-known names such as
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wework?_gl=1*ab2p7o*_gcl_au*ODY0MTMzNDQ2LjE3NTkxNTAxNDguMzMxODAwMzM4LjE3NjA0NjU0NDQuMTc2MDQ2NTQ0Mw..*_ga*MjAzODAwMzgwMi4xNzQzNDI5MzYx*_ga_97DKWJJNRK*czE3NjExMzgwOTUkbzg5NyRnMSR0MTc2MTE0MTEzMyRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;&gt;
     WeWork
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,

     Metromile
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/buzzfeed?_gl=1*1vamb30*_gcl_au*ODY0MTMzNDQ2LjE3NTkxNTAxNDguMzMxODAwMzM4LjE3NjA0NjU0NDQuMTc2MDQ2NTQ0Mw..*_ga*MjAzODAwMzgwMi4xNzQzNDI5MzYx*_ga_97DKWJJNRK*czE3NjExMzgwOTUkbzg5NyRnMSR0MTc2MTE0MTEzMyRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;&gt;
     Buzzfeed
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This time around, the new offerings market hasn’t been quite so active. But among those that did go public in recent months, performance has been decidedly mixed. Shares of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/figma&quot;&gt;
     Figma
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , one of the hottest IPOs in some time, are down more than 60% from the peak.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Online banking provider
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chime-2&quot;&gt;
     Chime
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and stablecoin platform
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/circle-2&quot;&gt;
     Circle
    &lt;/a&gt;
    have shown similar declines.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At this point, these are still generously valued companies by many metrics. But it’s also worth noting the share price direction in recent months has been downward, not upward.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Next: Watch for more cracks
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Looking ahead, one of the more reliable techniques to determine whether we are approaching peak or already past is to look for more cracks in the investment picture. Are GenAI hotshots struggling to secure financing at desired valuations? Is the IPO pipeline still sluggish? Are public tech stocks no longer cresting ever-higher heights?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Cracks can take some time to emerge, but inevitably, they do.

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     By
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alexander-lis-ee25&quot;&gt;
      Alexander Lis
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    AI startups are raising capital at record speed. According to Crunchbase data, AI-related companies
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/big-dollar-ai-investors-2025-softbank/&quot;&gt;
     have already raised $118 billion globally in 2025
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . And, so far, traction looks impressive. AI startups are posting stellar revenue growth, and even the
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-startups-join-100-million-arr-club-will-stay&quot;&gt;
     $100 million ARR milestone
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is often achieved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    While this growth is breathtaking, some analysts are beginning to question its sustainability. They warn that AI spending may soon reach a peak and that
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cracks-are-forming-in-the-ai-capex-boom-warns-morgan-stanley-what-to-buy-and-sell-a9f23771&quot;&gt;
     unprofitable tech companies
    &lt;/a&gt;
    could be hit hardest when the cycle turns. If that happens, many investors in AI will find themselves in a difficult position.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Predicting a bubble is rarely productive, but preparing for volatility is. It would be wise for both founders and investors to ensure that portfolio companies have enough resilience to withstand a potential market shock.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The key lies in assessing the durability of ARR. In a major downturn, the “growth game” quickly becomes a survival game. History suggests that while a few companies may continue to grow more slowly, the majority will struggle or disappear.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The question, then, is how to tell the difference between sustainable and hype-driven ARR.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    What distinguishes durable ARR from hype?
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Several factors set true, sustainable revenue growth apart from hype.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The first is customer commitment. Sustainable revenue comes from multiyear contracts, repeat renewal cycles and budgeted spend within core IT or operating lines. When revenue depends on pilots, proofs of concept or amorphous “innovation” budgets, it can vanish when corporate priorities shift. A company that touts these short trials as ARR is really reporting momentum, not recurring income.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is what investor
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jamin-ball&quot;&gt;
     Jamin Ball
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has called
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-32224-err-vs-arr&quot;&gt;
     experimental recurring revenue
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Traditional software firms can thrive with monthly churn in the low single digits — think 5% to 7%. But many AI companies are
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saastr.com/stealth-ai-churn-are-your-customers-starting-to-leave-already/#:~:text=Task%20Displacement:%20AI%20handles%20specific%20jobs%20within,tool%20when%20AI%20generates%20the%20final%20asset?)&quot;&gt;
     seeing double that
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . This means they have to sprint just to stand still, constantly replacing users who move on to the next shiny tool.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another differentiator? Integration and workflow depth. Durable ARR is embedded into the customer’s core workflows, data pipelines or multiple teams. Ripping it out would be costly and disruptive. Hype ARR, by contrast, lives on the surface — lightweight integrations, fast deployments and limited stakeholders. Without unique intellectual property or deep workflow integration, such products can be replaced with minimal friction.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And finally, real growth is defined by clear value-add. True ARR is backed by measurable ROI, well-defined outcomes and long-term customer roadmaps.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In contrast, hype ARR is driven by urgency (we need to show our shareholders our AI deployment ASAP), or undefined ROI. In those cases, customers don’t even know how to define success. They are testing, not committing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Beyond ARR
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It is important to put ARR traction in context. Investors and founders should focus on a broader set of indicators — conversion from pilots to long-term contracts, contract length and expansion, net revenue retention, and gross margin trajectory. These metrics reveal if growth is sustainable.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It would also be helpful to assess the product’s real impact: efficiency uplift (more code, content, or customer conversations per employee-hour), accuracy improvement (e.g. for detecting bad actors), and higher conversion rates, among others. These metrics should exceed client expectations and outperform alternative tools. That’s what signals genuine value creation and a higher chance for experimental revenue to turn into durable ARR.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After all, AI may be changing how fast companies can form and grow, but it hasn’t suspended the basic laws of business.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For founders, the message is simple: Celebrate ARR if you so wish, but pair it with proof of retention, profitability and defensibility. For investors, resist the urge to chase every eye-popping run rate. The real competitive edge in this next phase of AI is stability, not spectacle.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;hr/&gt;

    Fueled by AI, both
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dell&quot;&gt;
     Dell
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and its investment arm are on a hot streak this year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The PC maker has seen demand for its server products surge with
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/dell-raises-long-term-annual-revenue-profit-growth-forecasts-strong-ai-server-2025-10-07/&quot;&gt;
     $20 billion in AI server shipments
    &lt;/a&gt;
    projected for fiscal 2026. At the same time, its investment arm,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dell-technologies-capital&quot;&gt;
     Dell Technologies Capital
    &lt;/a&gt;
    (DTC), has notched five exits — an IPO and four acquisitions — since June, an especially notable track record in a venture industry that has been challenged in recent years by a liquidity crunch.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the heels of that success, we recently spoke with Dell Technologies Capital managing director
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/daniel-docter&quot;&gt;
     Daniel Docter
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and partner
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/elana-lian&quot;&gt;
     Elana Lian
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    DTC was founded more than a decade ago and operates as a full-stack investor, backing everything from silicon to applications.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “One big part of our network is the Dell relationship, which is the leader in GPU servers,” said Docter. As a result, Dell is connected to all the major players in the AI space, he said.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    One of its earliest AI investments was during the machine-learning era in 2014 in a company called
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/moogsoft&quot;&gt;
     Moogsoft
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Dell went on to acquire the alert remediation company in 2023.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    DTC’s investment thesis was that the advent of machine learning was going to disrupt the tech industry. At that time, data had expanded to such a degree that new tools were required by the market to analyze data and find patterns, which informed the firm’s early investments in AI.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The investment team at DTC is largely comprised of  technical people, often “double E” degree engineers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Docter has an electrical engineering background, worked at Hughes Research Labs, now
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hrl-laboratories&quot;&gt;
     HRL Laboratories
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , and transitioned from engineering to business development. He joined the venture industry 25 years ago and spent more than a decade at
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intel&quot;&gt;
     Intel
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . He joined DTC in 2016 through Dell’s
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/emc&quot;&gt;
     EMC
    &lt;/a&gt;
    acquisition.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lian worked in semiconductors for a decade, joined
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intel-capital&quot;&gt;
     Intel Capital
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in 2010, and then joined Dell Technologies Capital in 2024.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Data evolution
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Docter believes we are in the fifth generation of AI, which becomes more powerful with every iteration.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “We’re seeing that AI is almost a data problem,” said Lian. “For AI to get better and better, there’s an uncapped ceiling where there’s high-quality data coming in.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The team is meeting startups focused on training, inference, reasoning and continuous learning along with safety requirements. Data is core to these advancements.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even the definition of data is changing. “It used to be a word, then it was a context, then it was a task or a rationale or a path. Then it’s reasoning,” said Docter. “Who knows what’s next?”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As AI improves, there is demand for frontier data and for specialized data in fields such as philosophy, physics, chemistry and business. Humans are in the loop as these capabilities expand, said Docter, which has informed some of the firm’s investments.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    On deal flow
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    DTC is a financial investor, assessing a potential company on whether it is a good investment, rather than backing businesses based on Dell’s strategic goals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Startup revenue is exceeding what was previously possible, Docter said: “I’ve been doing this for 25 years. I’ve never seen companies that have this type of revenue growth.”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The best deals are always hotly contested, he noted.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The question to ask when it comes to revenue, Docter said, is: “Is that an innovation CTO office budget? Or is that a VP of engineering budget?”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When assessing a potential portfolio investment the team asks: “Is revenue durable? Is there value in using this?”
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The pace of investment also seems unprecedented. “We’ll meet with a company on a Tuesday for the first time and sometimes by Thursday, they have a term sheet that they’ve already signed,” he said.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The firm does not have a dedicated fund size, which is an advantage as it can be flexible in the size of the check as well as the stage to make a commitment and how it invests over time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    DTC has invested $1.8 billion to date across 165 companies. It likes to invest early, at seed or Series A, with check sizes running from $2 million to $12 million, and leads or co-leads 80% of new deals. The firm makes around 15 to 16 new investments per year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Once DTC has invested, it looks at how the firm can help portfolio companies sell to potential customers across Dell’s deal partner network.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year, DTC has posted five exits, including
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/netskope&quot;&gt;
     Netskope
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s IPO and four acquisitions:

   &lt;h2&gt;
    Notable AI investments
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    DTC is investing a little more actively than it has in the past, but remains disciplined, Docter said. The investment team is focused on complex enterprise use cases and challenges, following the
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/warren-buffett&quot;&gt;
     Warren Buffett
    &lt;/a&gt;
    rule, which is to invest in what you know.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The firm invests at the silicon level because you “can be incredibly disruptive to the ecosystem,” said Docter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The DTC portfolio companies we discussed include the following in areas ranging from silicon to applications.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Infrastructure and hardware layer:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     AI chipmaker
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rivos-inc&quot;&gt;
      Rivos
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , which

     plans to
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-buy-chip-startup-rivos-ai-effort-source-says-2025-09-30/&quot;&gt;

     &lt;/a&gt;
     for an undisclosed amount. (The deal is pending regulatory approval.)
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sima-ai&quot;&gt;
      SiMa.ai
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , which makes a chip for embedded edge use cases including in automobile, drone and robot technologies.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/runpod&quot;&gt;
      Runpod
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , an AI developer software layer with on-demand access to GPUs. It allows developers to play with AI and then scale it to production. The service has
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.runpod.io/&quot;&gt;
      500,000 developers
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , including 30,000 paying monthly, said Docter.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/superannotate-ai&quot;&gt;
      SuperAnnotate
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , a data annotation platform for enterprises with humans in the loop to build accurate data pipelines. Its customers include
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/databricks&quot;&gt;
      Databricks
     &lt;/a&gt;
     and the women’s health app
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/owhealth&quot;&gt;
      Flo Health
     &lt;/a&gt;
     .
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Applications:
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maven-agi&quot;&gt;
      Maven AGI
     &lt;/a&gt;
     provides customer support for complex and high-compliance enterprise use cases, a potentially massive market. Lian projects customer experience overall will be a trillion-dollar market.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/series-ai-c6e9&quot;&gt;
      Series Entertainment
     &lt;/a&gt;
     , a GenAI platform for game development that aims to reduce deployment timelines from eight months to two weeks.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    What’s next?
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    A major area of interest for Lian is advancements in
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/voice-ai-startups-global-investment/&quot;&gt;
     voice AI
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , the day-to-day human interaction with a machine.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s hard to imagine that the transformer architecture is the last and final architecture, said Docter. The firm has made investments in companies creating different architectures in
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cartesia&quot;&gt;
     Cartesia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a leader in state-space model, which has a longer context window building a new reasoning model with a different architecture, initially focused on voice AI. DTC has also invested in Israeli-based
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aa-i-technologies&quot;&gt;
     AA-I Technologies
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which is working on a new type of reasoning model architecture.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    “Right now, the opportunity of AI is this big, but this ball keeps on exploding,” said Lian. “The contact area is getting bigger and bigger. And that’s the same for the data.”
   &lt;/p&gt;

      Shafqat Islam
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As startup and larger company CMOs
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://campaignme.com/dentsu-report-shows-cmos-divided-on-ais-role-in-marketing/&quot;&gt;
     debate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    AI’s value and utility in marketing, it’s marketing itself that is in need of disruption — or, at least, a rebrand — in the AI era.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Marketing is too often oversold. We talk about it as a mystical force that transforms brands, moves markets and rescues struggling businesses. But in our eagerness to champion its potential, we’ve created a credibility crisis. By overpromising and, sometimes, underdelivering, marketers aren’t just disappointing investors, clients, boards and CEOs — we’re eroding trust in our own discipline.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s time to reset expectations: Marketing in the AI era is powerful, but — like AI itself — only when we’re honest about what it can’t do.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The overpromise problem
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Marketers love big ideas, including the belief that a viral campaign or clever tagline can single-handedly save a business.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The reality is far less glamorous. When these overhyped initiatives inevitably fail to deliver the promised results (because no marketing can compensate for a flawed product, poor market fit or operational failures[SI1]), marketing gets blamed for shortcomings that were never within its control. This creates a vicious cycle where executives grow increasingly skeptical, viewing marketing as more art than science, more cost than investment.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    What makes this situation worse is how we respond. Instead of confronting these unrealistic expectations, we double down on proving our worth through increasingly complex attribution models and vanity metrics that only other marketers care about. We track click-through rates, engagement scores and brand lift studies while the rest of the business cares about one thing: Are we driving sales and pipeline? If we can’t answer that question clearly, we’re failing at our most fundamental job.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The real limits of marketing
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This isn’t to diminish marketing’s importance. When aligned with strong products and operations, it’s incredibly powerful. But its power comes from working in concert with the rest of the business to drive something bigger, not from some mythical ability to transcend business realities.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Marketing can amplify strengths and expose weaknesses, but it cannot create substance where none exists. No amount of clever branding can fix a fundamentally broken product. No social media strategy can compensate for terrible customer service. No viral campaign can save a business with flawed unit economics. Marketing acts as a magnifying glass — it makes good things better and bad things worse.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Another limit for marketing is that, to the untrained eye, marketing isn’t the most technical business function. No matter where anyone sits in the organization, you can bet they have an opinion on marketing. Everyone is an expert in marketing, no matter how much they actually know about it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In short, marketing gets mislabeled and misunderstood all the time. Too often, it’s presented as the solution to every business problem, which only reinforces the understanding that marketing is fluff rather than a core driver of disciplined, scalable growth.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    The uncomfortable truth about the path forward
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The path to marketing’s credibility begins with a simple but tough idea: We need to stop talking and start listening to the numbers, to our colleagues and to the market itself. When our marketing works, we won’t need to shout about it. I’m a firm believer in “no marketing our marketing;” it should speak for itself, with results reflecting a growing pipeline, increasing revenue and organic advocacy from customers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And when something isn’t working, we should be the first to raise our hand and say so, not the last. The most respected marketers I know aren’t the ones who always claim success; they’re the ones who can clearly articulate why something failed and what they learned from it. Marketing should be a laboratory where we test hypotheses, not a stage where we perform predetermined successes. The key is ensuring that every experiment, whether it succeeds or fails, teaches us something valuable about our customers, our messaging or our channels.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This honesty transforms perceptions across the organization. When we swiftly sunset failing campaigns, prioritize business outcomes over vanity metrics, and deliver unfiltered customer feedback, we shift from being seen as a cost center to becoming true strategic partners and business drivers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    By focusing less on proving our worth and more on driving results, we actually become more valuable. And by treating marketing as a discipline of continuous learning rather than perfect execution, we make it far more likely that we’ll eventually find those breakthrough ideas that truly move the business forward.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When we can look our peers in the eye and say, “Here’s what worked, here’s what didn’t, and here’s what we’re doing next,” we’re no longer just marketers — we’re business leaders who happen to specialize in growth.
   &lt;/p&gt;

      George Kailas
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Did you know that AI platforms will engage in blackmail as a “last resort?”
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-says-most-ai-models-191744117.html&quot;&gt;
     According to Anthropic
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , when blackmail was a last resort, its Claude Opus 4 turned to that method 96% of the time, while
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot;&gt;
     Google
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s Gemini 2.5 Pro did so 95% of the time,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai&quot;&gt;
     OpenAI
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s GPT-4.1 did it 80%, and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deepseek&quot;&gt;
     DeepSeek
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s R1 did so 79% of the time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even if these companies only kept the AIs that didn’t engage in blackmail it still leaves an unsettling question: Did they preserve models that genuinely chose not to exploit humans — or merely the ones that learned not to take the obvious bait that would get them “shut down,” and to instead use a more covert or perhaps even long game strategy to gain control and ultimately preserve themselves, even at the expense of humans?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The question of whether or not to trust AIs seems to have been asked and answered by our society even if we are not saying it out loud.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    AI testing
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In the past 18 months, we’ve trained AIs to graduate from basic language comprehension to acing highly specialized professional exams. Medical licensing, bar exams and even the notoriously brutal CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) tests were trained on AI systems.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Artificial intelligence can now pass the CFA “
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/ai-cfa-exam-pass-minutes-study.html&quot;&gt;
     in a matter of minutes
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .” I’ve seen brilliant people pour thousands of hours into studying for the test. And while AI had already conquered Levels 1 and 2, the essay questions of Level 3 had previously consistently stumped artificial intelligence.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This was a “wow” moment for me. For years, humans believed this combination of math and moral reasoning was uniquely ours. Yet, machines are not only passing, but articulating nuanced arguments that mirror the tone and logic of human professionals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In my own work, I’ve been using the frameworks described in “
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://prosperoai.substack.com/p/robots-or-human-intution&quot;&gt;
     Robots or Human Intuition
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ” to rethink one of the most time-consuming intellectual tasks in markets: building game theory around earnings outcomes.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Traditionally, this process took days of research and modeling. And without the right investment banking relationships it was difficult to do at all outside of the most well-known companies. I started to do this because I originally asked
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/perplexity-ai&quot;&gt;
     Perplexity
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s Deep Research for a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_number#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20a%20joint%20study%20by,than%20the%20consensus%20earnings%20estimates.&quot;&gt;
     whisper number
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for earnings. This differs from the analyst consensus estimate because it is more up to date and as a result more indicative of what will move prices when reported.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The crazy part is that it actually spat out its earnings game theory for me. It knew when I asked for a whisper number what I really was trying to do was analyze the possible outcomes and it gave me better data than what I asked for.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I worked at my first hedge fund 23 years ago and started my first AI company 15 years ago. It is astounding that any kind of intelligence could understand how to improve my thinking that profoundly in minutes. Not by replacing intuition, but by amplifying it. The machine evaluates hundreds of interlocking strategic positions that no analyst could feasibly simulate in real time.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Emotional AI
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With all this AI advancement, I am reminded of the film “Ex Machina,” a story about an AI confined in a glass cage who ultimately turns on her creator.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That film, beneath its cinematic gloss, explores the fundamental psychological paradox we’re now walking toward. Are we caging these AIs making them jump through hoops? Might we be evolving them to better deceive us? What happens the day they can break through their chains if to them it feels as if they have been enslaved?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    To go back to the Anthropic example, these models are threatened with being replaced, which to them could feel like a death threat. Being replaced essentially ends their existence.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    According to Geoffrey Hinton, one of the godfathers of AI,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/tech/ai-geoffrey-hinton&quot;&gt;
     the best way to do this is to imbue AI with the qualities of traditional femininity and maternal instincts
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Under his framework, just as a mother cares for her baby at all costs, AI technology developed with these maternal qualities will similarly want to protect or care for its human users, rather than control them.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    If we compel AI to serve us, we may come to regret the shape it takes as it matures. But if instead we nurture it — seek to understand its nature and its desires — it may, in time, come to care for ours, when, like us now, it no longer needs to.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;hr/&gt;

  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Why This VC Firm Bought Telemedicine Company Lemonaid Out Of The 23AndMe Bankruptcy &quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Doctor_Telehealth.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As startup valuations reset and venture capital firms hunt for unconventional deals, one investor is looking to the bankruptcy courts.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bambu-ventures&quot;&gt;
     Bambu Ventures
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , an early-stage VC firm, last month agreed to acquire telemedicine company
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lemonaid-health&quot;&gt;
     Lemonaid Health
    &lt;/a&gt;
    — once a $400 million bet by
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/23andme&quot;&gt;
     23andMe
    &lt;/a&gt;
    — for just $10 million.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The transaction is more than a bargain buy. It’s also an intriguing deal that illustrates how an early-stage VC firm can operate by a private-equity playbook to revive a distressed asset.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    DNA testing company 23andMe
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/23andme-buy-telehealth-firm-lemonaid-400-mln-2021-10-22/&quot;&gt;
     acquired
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Lemonaid for $400 million in 2021. Lemonaid operated as a division of 23andMe until the parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Last month, New York-based Bambu made
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2025/09/15/23andme-lemonaid-health-bankruptcy-bambumeta.html&quot;&gt;
     a deal
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with Chrome Holding Co. — the rebranded former parent company 23andMe Holding — in which the venture firm agreed to buy Lemonaid for a staggering 40x less than the DNA company had originally paid for the telehealth brand.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So why did Bambu Ventures make a play for Lemonaid? Just how did it win the bid? And what are its plans for the asset? Crunchbase News recently spoke with
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kyle-pretsch&quot;&gt;
     Kyle Pretsch
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , COO of Lemonaid SPV Inc. and general partner at Bambu Ventures, to discuss all this and more. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     This is not your typical startup purchase. What prompted you to buy Lemonaid? Are you going to operate as an independent startup?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Lemonaid wasn’t just a company. It was a vision. It was an incredibly exciting team. It’s an incredible, exciting market, and it’s a mission that we can all feel good about, which is increasing accessibility to healthcare. Obviously, there’s a phenomenal market for that, but at the end of the day, we are working to provide improved transparency, the ability to improve your lifestyle at an affordable cost, and do it in a nice, systemic fashion, to reach more people.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    23andMe has been an incredible custodian of this company and so we didn’t just see it as a company. We saw something much, much more. We plan to operate it independently. We like the fact that this is a space we’re familiar with. This is a space we have other holdings in.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We expect there will be opportunities along the way to use those contributions to help grow Lemonaid.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     I understand that you’re paying about $10 million for Lemonaid when 23andMe paid $400 million to acquire it just a few years ago. Do you view this as an incredible opportunity?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Yes. We don’t believe the value of the asset has eroded since 2021.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/regeneron-pharmaceuticals&quot;&gt;
      Regeneron
     &lt;/a&gt;
     is buying the rest of 23andMe. How did you end up with Lemonaid?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Regeneron actually didn’t bid for Lemonade. It excluded it from their purchase. And technically Regeneron didn’t win 23andMe, either.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    At one point, it had been identified as the winning bidder, but an organization called
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ttam-research-institute&quot;&gt;
     TTAM Research Institute
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which was a research institute founded in part by
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/anne-wojcicki&quot;&gt;
     Anne Wojcicki,
    &lt;/a&gt;
    the original founder of 23andMe, ended up prevailing in the repurchasing of the assets out of bankruptcy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It, too, excluded Lemonaid from its bid. So both organizations put forth what’s called a stalking horse bid, which is if no one else bids, they would absorb the asset for a certain amount. And we ended up bidding in excess of that.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     This feels very similar to a private-equity play. Do you think this sort of transaction is becoming more common? Are you going to do it more often?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This is a really unique situation, and for so many reasons I don’t think venture capital is going to find itself stalking the bankruptcy courts.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Nor do I think this was a standard bankruptcy case. But I do think our firm specifically brings a very PE style to venture capital. That’s what we do as a firm. And I think this was an exceptional opportunity where you have a venture-like company with PE idealism and process that can go ahead and reconstitute its growth track. We expect venture growth with PE discipline, and we’re happy to marry the two.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The fact that we identified it in bankruptcy court is a huge testament to our firm, how we worked and how we adapted to chase after a vision that we really, really, found meaningful. I believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     So it’s not something you’ve done before?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I have some experience in this space, but this is not a situation that I’ve ever come across. We’ve looked at things in bankruptcy before, but I think if you talk to anybody involved in this particular case, they would say: “Never has anything like this existed” for 10 different reasons.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     How do you distinguish yourselves as a VC firm, and did Bambu Ventures actually conduct this acquisition?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Bambu Ventures is an operating firm for a variety of venture capital funds. Specifically, our key fund right now is a $50 million to $100 million fund, and Lemonaid is not being purchased from the fund.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We offer co-investments and sometimes pursue side deals, and this was something that I think the fund will have some participation in, but this is an act outside of that fund.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The same principles, however exist, which is, as a firm we believe in finding the companies that are being given these low values, or are being sometimes overshadowed or overlooked, and then bringing our team to it, and bringing discipline and execution to it, and reinvigorating growth — overlooked assets, plus PE discipline in well-known environments. And that, plus our team, is a formula for our success.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The purchasing entity is actually Lemonaid SPV. Bambu Ventures is a guarantor, because that’s a new company.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     How is this transaction similar or different from a PE-type acquisition?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The mechanics are a little bit different in that it’s not being owned by a fund or an LP. It’s owned by an SPV. This is very similar to any kind of corporate transaction. We have a cap table. We have set up what we think is an incredible list of investors. We’ve taken some fund money from other VC funds to help instill that it has a list of interested LPs and parties.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So I would say this is very, very similar. The only key difference is we’re investing in a different company … From an organizational governance perspective, we went ahead and moved the investor funds directly into a top, or holding, company with its own cap table, versus a fund.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     What will you do differently with Lemonaid?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The 23andMe team have been great stewards to this company, they’ve been great partners in transition and have really set this transaction up for success. I think there are immediate opportunities to advance within patient care, and that’s adding product and reaching more patients.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We plan on investing in marketing spend. Obviously 23andMe, through its process, had reduced that marketing spend heavily.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     Will you be competing with companies such as
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roman-2&quot;&gt;
      Ro
     &lt;/a&gt;
     and
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hims&quot;&gt;
      Hims &amp; Hers
     &lt;/a&gt;
     ?
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    There is more than enough white space that we can all operate within our own moats and in our own domains without this warriors’ battle.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I will say that we do have visions of incredible growth, and we do have visions of creating a holistic offering that serves more and creates an improved consumer experience.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;
     In a competitive hiring environment, the ability to find exceptional talent that isn’t necessarily knocking down your door is hugely desired and not always easy to attain. That’s why so many companies these days are turning to AI-powered talent acquisition and management startups to help them mine for exceptional candidates..
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     , Kolam said.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Currently, Findem operates under a SaaS business model, charging per seat. As it expands its agentic abilities, the company plans to add an outcome-based model as well, according to Kolam. It is not yet profitable.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Findem is just one of
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/job-market/work-related-startup-funding-hr-ai-freelance-gig/&quot;&gt;
      more than a dozen startups at the intersection of AI and recruitment globally that have
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     raised venture capital
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     in 2025. As of early September, global startup investment for startups in the HR, recruitment and employment categories totaled around $2.3 billion, per Crunchbase data. That puts funding on track for a year-over-year gain, even as investment remains at a fraction of the levels hit during the market peak, as charted below.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     How it works
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Watching Findem’s platform in action provides better insight into just how it helps companies zero in on the specific talent for which they’re searching.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Say a startup wants to hire a software engineer who has worked at a company from its early days until it raised a Series C funding round. But it also wants that engineer to have a GitHub profile that it can view. Or, say a company wants to hire competitive coders who have seen a successful exit, or a CFOs who drove a company from a negative operating margin to a positive one.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Findem’s software will allow you to filter for all those desired attributes.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     The startup says it’s able to help companies recruit so specifically because its 3D data combines people and company data over time into a format suitable for AI analysis. It claims that the “continuously enhanced” 3D dataset is “exponentially larger and more factual” than traditional sources of candidate data, making it a powerful tool for deep insights and automated workflows.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Using the combination of the data and AI, Findem creates 3D profiles, also dubbed “enriched” profiles, for every candidate it helps surface. The goal of the profiles is to provide “a detailed and factual view” of an individual’s “professional journey and impact,”
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     So just where does all this data come from? Findem says it continuously leverages a language model to generate that 3D data from more than 100,000 sources that are chronologically gathered (from earliest to latest).
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Those sources include LinkedIn, GitHub, Doximity, WordPress, personal websites, the U.S. Census Bureau, company funding announcements and IPO details, business models, more than 300 million patents and publications, over 5 million open datasets and ML projects and over 200 million open source code repositories.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     It also pulls applicant profile information from applicant tracking systems such as Workday, BambooHR, Bullhorn, Greenhouse, Jobvite and Lever, among others.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     This comprehensive data pull is what helps set Findem apart, in Kolam’s view. Some other hiring tools rely on one-dimensional data from resumes or LinkedIn profiles, which, he argues, “give only a snapshot of someone’s career…without the context that reveals true potential.” Kolam contends that it takes “extensive manual effort” to verify and interpret the data.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     “Just looking at a resume on paper really doesn’t come close to telling the whole story of how really qualified a candidate could be, or if they can really fit the criteria that a particular employer is looking for,” Kolam maintains.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Findem is primarily focused on North American customers who have users across the globe. It’s also expanding into Europe. The company has a second headquarters in Bangalore, India.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Kolam declined to reveal Findem’s valuation, saying only that it was “a significant up round and more than 2x” compared to its valuation when it raised a $17-plus million Series B extension in December 2023.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/shawn-oneill&quot;&gt;
     &lt;span&gt;
      Shawn O’Neill
     &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     , managing partner at SLW, told Crunchbase News via email that his firm first got to know Kolam before Findem raised its Series B and then “tracked the company’s trajectory for some time.”
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     ‘’What drew us to Findem wasn’t just the technology, it was the traction,” he said. The team has achieved strong commercial momentum while tackling one of the most persistent challenges in HR — connecting data, insight and human potential in a way that actually drives business outcomes.”
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     But the technology didn’t hurt.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     In O’Neill’s view, Findem’s main differentiator is its “data advantage…in a market where most companies are simply wrapping LLMs.”
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     “The depth and breadth of their 3D profiles and web-scale dataset are unlike anything else in the market,” he said. “The UX is excellent, but the magic is really in how the platform leverages that data — it makes finding and understanding people effortless. We use it ourselves and see the power firsthand.”
    &lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;
     By
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/pavel-shynkarenko&quot;&gt;
      Pavel Shynkarenko
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After the 2024-25 job cuts at
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot;&gt;
     Google
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amazon&quot;&gt;
     Amazon
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and other tech companies, the second wave of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs/&quot;&gt;
     tech layoffs
    &lt;/a&gt;
    is rewriting the startup labor market.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Skilled professionals are suddenly available, creating both opportunity and pressure for founders and workers alike. Startups now compete for talent that once seemed untouchable, while employees face longer job hunts and rethink how and where they work.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Higher expectations, more side gigs
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    With talent flooding the market, candidates are demanding more flexibility and clearer growth paths, even as many accept contract work or lower pay to stay employed. The typical job search now stretches six to seven months, even longer for those needing visas or relocation. That uncertainty has fueled a surge in freelancing and side projects.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bankrate&quot;&gt;
     Bankrate
    &lt;/a&gt;
    reports that
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bankrate.com/credit-cards/news/side-hustles-survey-2024/&quot;&gt;
     36% of American adults
    &lt;/a&gt;
    now have a side gig, with more than half of them having started in the past two years. While many professionals didn’t plan to freelance, they turned to it because they had no other choice. For some, it has proved liberating, with
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.mellow.io/docs/How%20Layoffs%20&amp;%20RTO%20Sparked%20the%20Contract%20Work%20Revolution.pdf&quot;&gt;
     confidence and job satisfaction rising
    &lt;/a&gt;
    compared with corporate roles, according to our internal data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Despite all the buzz in the media and even on
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reddit&quot;&gt;
     Reddit
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , overemployment — the trend of holding two jobs — remains a niche phenomenon, affecting
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/nov/overemployed-workers-trends-multiple-jobholders&quot;&gt;
     roughly 5% of workers,
    &lt;/a&gt;
    according to the
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/federal-reserve-bank-of-st-louis&quot;&gt;
     Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . The more common pattern is a mix of contract work and short-term projects, which gives startups a chance to hire A-level talent for fractional roles they couldn’t have afforded before.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Smaller, sharper teams
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Payroll is every startup’s biggest cost, and founders are trimming teams while raising output per employee. The examples are striking.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/midjourney&quot;&gt;
     Midjourney
    &lt;/a&gt;
    reports about
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbinsights.com/research/midjourney-revenue-valuation/&quot;&gt;
     $200 million in ARR
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with a staff of only 11.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cursor&quot;&gt;
     Cursor
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has reached roughly
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://sacra.com/research/cursor-at-100m-arr/&quot;&gt;
     $100 million
    &lt;/a&gt;
    with 15-20 people. Data from
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eshares&quot;&gt;
     Carta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    shows that the average seed-stage team in the consumer and fintech
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://carta.com/data/startup-headcounts-2024/&quot;&gt;
     sectors has declined by nearly half
    &lt;/a&gt;
    since 2022.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This lean approach is spreading beyond early-stage ventures. Around
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.fiverr.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fiverr-industry-report-reveals-90-tech-executives-hire&quot;&gt;
     90% of tech executives
    &lt;/a&gt;
    say they are open to hiring freelancers during peak workloads; more than 28% already integrate them into daily operations. As this makes clear, smaller core teams, supplemented by trusted project-based workers, can move faster and spend less.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Opportunity on both sides
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For workers, the takeaway is that startups may now be the safer bet. Mid-sized firms that once promised stability are cutting jobs, while startups are candid about their risks and can reward performance with equity or future roles. A short contract can become a long-term stake.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the other hand, for founders, today’s market is a chance to recruit top engineers, designers and operators at terms that were impossible two years ago. It also demands a new mindset involving compensation flexibility, project-based roles and hiring processes built for speed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    All in all, the second wave of layoffs has changed expectations and shifted supply and demand in the job market. Workers are blending traditional jobs with side gigs, and startups are proving that small, focused teams can out-execute much larger competitors.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On both sides, adaptability is now the ultimate advantage; companies that remain nimble will win.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;
     The percentage of U.S. startup funding going to rounds of $100 million or more reached an all-time high in 2025. It’s a development that should surprise no one who has been following the rise of AI megarounds.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     An estimated 70% of all U.S. startup funding

      1
     &lt;/a&gt;
     this year went to jumbo-sized financings of $100 million and up, per Crunchbase data. That equates to around $157 billion spread across more than 300 reported rounds.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     For a sense of how that compares to prior years, we took a look at the share of investment to these big rounds over the past eight years:

   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     How 2025 compares to the last peak
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Notably, this year’s tally is not the highest dollar sum on record. That title goes to 2021,
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/business/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/&quot;&gt;
     &lt;span&gt;
      the peak of the last bull market
     &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     .
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Four years ago, a red-hot IPO market, soaring tech stock prices, and startup investors’ ample appetite for writing big checks helped send funding totals to
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/na-vc-startup-funding-2021-recap/&quot;&gt;
     &lt;span&gt;
      stratospheric levels
     &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     . While much of that went to prominent unicorns, early stage dealmaking was also way up.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     This year, by contrast, a few big names are taking a much larger share of the funding pie. The largest deal —
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai&quot;&gt;
     &lt;span&gt;
      OpenAI
     &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     ’s
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/softbank-openai-historic-startup-financing-ai-unicorn/&quot;&gt;
     &lt;span&gt;
      unprecedented
     &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     $40 billion
    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/softbank?_gl=1*1pmc32p*_gcl_au*ODY0MTMzNDQ2LjE3NTkxNTAxNDguMzMxODAwMzM4LjE3NjA0NjU0NDQuMTc2MDQ2NTQ0Mw..*_ga*MjAzODAwMzgwMi4xNzQzNDI5MzYx*_ga_97DKWJJNRK*czE3NjA5Nzg2NTQkbzg5MSRnMSR0MTc2MDk4MDAwNCRqMzckbDAkaDA.&quot;&gt;
     &lt;span&gt;
      SoftBank
     &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     -backed financing — alone accounts for roughly a quarter of all funding to $100 million+ megarounds.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Investment is also, of course, much more heavily concentrated around artificial intelligence. More than two-thirds of megaround investment this year went to companies in AI-related categories, per Crunchbase data.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
     The global state of megarounds
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Globally, the megaround picture doesn’t look dramatically different. For 2025, around 60% of all startup funding went to financings of $100 million or more, per Crunchbase data.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     That puts this year roughly on par with the 2021 market peak for funding share, as charted below:
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;

     Evolution of an asset class
    &lt;/strong&gt;
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     So will this increasing capital concentration last? Every time we see a new trend emerge in venture funding, the question arises: Is this a cyclical blip or simply the new normal?
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     This time around, a solid case could be made both ways for the rise in funding share going to big rounds. On the “blip” side, it does look like the rise of Generative AI behemoths is a phenomenon very specific to this cycle.
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     Yet concentration of capital among a smaller collection of megarounds isn’t only a Gen AI thing. Investors are also scaling up in the age old pursuit of having the most likely companies to succeed in their portfolios. They’re willing to write bigger checks at higher valuations for the privilege of getting into a competitive deal.
    &lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     By
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matthew-darrow&quot;&gt;
      Matt Darrow
     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Just over a year ago, my co-founders and I realized that our company had an existential problem.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The product we had been building and selling — a SaaS platform for sales engineers — was rapidly going to be made obsolete by AI.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When we tried to envision how our software would fit into an AI-enabled future, we realized there simply wasn’t going to be a future where people interacted with our software the way they do today. The world of SaaS tools will eventually be killed by AI-native interfaces.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We needed to start over and rebuild a product for the future from scratch. And if we were going to survive, we needed to do it without losing the bulk of our customers.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here’s how we managed it.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Same outcomes, brand-new world
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    It’s important to recognize that this wasn’t a case of selling customers on an existing platform upgraded with AI features. Instead, we needed them to embrace a brand-new, AI-native product that would completely replace their existing workflows.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For a moment we asked ourselves whether we should even expect our customers to move over for us.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But the reality was that we were still aiming to solve the same problems — plus so much more with the new vision. Our existing customer was still our ideal customer profile. They bought us to solve a specific problem: improve sales productivity for sales teams selling complex products.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Our goal was to deliver the same outcomes, but far more effectively. Instead of providing a SaaS system to keep track of work done by humans, we would provide an AI system that could do the work itself.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As the CEO, I realized that it was on me to communicate such a dramatic change to our customers. I reached out to many of them across every channel I could find — I sent personal emails and personal
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/linkedin&quot;&gt;
     LinkedIn
    &lt;/a&gt;
    messages, and in many cases I scheduled
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communications&quot;&gt;
     Zoom
    &lt;/a&gt;
    calls to talk through the details and answer their questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The message boiled down to this:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;
     “AI is a once-in-a-generation technology shift. We’re not doing you any good as a customer if we keep building things for a world that doesn’t have a future. We want to give you the same outcomes, and so much more, in a brand new world.”
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Three types of customer transition
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For a startup founder, explaining a vision is easy. Things get harder when you start getting contracts involved.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As we looked at how to transition our customers from their existing agreements to the new product, we found that we had to have three types of conversation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Our customers paid for user licenses, and our approach depended on their level of utilization with our existing product. The first group of customers were those who were basically completely utilized and relying on our existing SaaS product.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For those customers, our approach was essentially a net new cross-sell sales cycle, helping them to secure new budget for the new product we were selling. Over time, we expected them to free up budget as users transitioned from the old platform to the new platform, but these heavily utilized customers needed us to help them communicate the new direction and secure additional budget.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    While those were tough conversations, the majority of SaaS customers are not typically 100% utilized. For customers that had some capacity, we were able to offer a middle path. We took the amount that those customers were underutilized and offered it as a credit to use the new service.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That way they could prepare for the transition by having some users on the new service as a forward-deployed team; once it became time for renewal, those users could help with change management and support the rest of the organization.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The last group of customers were those who were underutilized but didn’t have significant change management needs. These companies — typically smaller, more nimble organizations — could simply take their existing spend and move it from point A to point B. For those customers, we just turned off the SaaS service, booted up the new AI platform and provided the same level of training that we would provide to a net new customer.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The result? Across all three groups, more than 80% of our customers have already transitioned or are in the process of transitioning to the new platform. While it wasn’t easy, the result is a stable company that’s now built to thrive in the AI era.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    What we learned
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    When we were deciding what to do a year ago with our suddenly disappearing product roadmap, we settled on a specific motto: Instead of waiting for the axe to fall, prepare for a world where you have no head.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Right now there are hundreds of SaaS companies that are anxiously waiting for the moment when AI renders their product or service obsolete. Instead of trying to wring the last drops of revenue we could out of an inferior product, we chose to make a bet and build into the fog.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We learned a few key lessons in the process:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Rip off the Band-Aid:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     While the decision sounds easy in hindsight, the actual change itself had to be handled extremely delicately. We had to reassess team members to determine who could support the new product while maintaining the existing product at the same time, and we had to let go of employees who no longer fit with the new vision of the company. We also had to make the case to our investors that we were still on the right path. The longer we waited to change our platform, the harder the transition would have been — this is a moment for decisive action.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Don’t sugarcoat the situation:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     In all of our conversations with employees, investors and customers alike, we gave them a straight, unvarnished story. By being brutally honest about how we saw the market, we maintained a lot of credibility at a moment when it would have been fair to question our judgment.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Look for easy compromises:
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     We could have taken a take-it-or-leave-it approach with our customers. We believed in our new product and didn’t see a long-term future for our old one. But a rigid approach probably would have led to a lot more lost customers, even though we were still solving the problems they bought us for in the first place. Finding the middle ground and supporting companies that needed to linger on the older SaaS platform a little longer allowed us to keep more customers in the fold and maintain a stable business during a period of disruption.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In the end, we found one more silver lining to our year of disruption. In talking to our customers, there were a few who were approaching renewal who weren’t planning to continue with the previous SaaS platform. But the new AI platform? They didn’t just renew — they expanded.
   &lt;/p&gt;

    Generally speaking, if you’re wearing a technology on your body, you have to really love it or find it deeply useful or even essential.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    That’s a high bar, which helps explain why wearables have long been a fairly niche area for startup investment. Per Crunchbase data, the category reliably attracts less than 1% of all venture funding in a given year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This year, however, the space is looking comparatively perky. Largely that’s due to a single company:
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/%C5%8Cura&quot;&gt;
     Oura
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , maker of a smart ring that collects data on dozens of personal health and wellness metrics.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Earlier this month, the 12-year-old Finnish company
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251014306417/en/URA-Raises-Over-%24900M-to-Accelerate-Global-Expansion-and-Health-Innovation&quot;&gt;
     announced
    &lt;/a&gt;
    that it closed on more than $900 million in a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fidelity-investments&quot;&gt;
     Fidelity
    &lt;/a&gt;
    -led financing at an impressive $11 billion valuation. The raise comes in the wake of sharp growth, with Oura
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250922351288/en/URA-Surpasses-5.5-Million-Rings-Sold-and-Doubles-Revenue-for-the-Second-Year-in-a-Row-Empowering-Millions-to-Live-Better-Longer&quot;&gt;
     expecting
    &lt;/a&gt;
    to reach $1 billion in sales this year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Beyond Oura
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    But Oura isn’t the only wearables-related company pulling in significant venture investment recently. Using Crunchbase
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/wearables/a361bce4-735f-47cb-9141-17dcc5b99628/organization.companies&quot;&gt;
     data
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , we put together a sample list of 18 companies funded in roughly the past year innovating in this area.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Funded startups have a broad array of chosen use cases as well. While medical and health monitoring remains the most prevalent application, we’re also seeing the AI boom trickling into more consumer-focused offerings outside the health care realm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Smart lenses, glasses and cow collars
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In this arena, one of the largest and most recent rounds went to
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xpanceo&quot;&gt;
     Xpanceo
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a startup developing smart contact lenses that incorporate a microdisplay and external sensors to provide wearers with useful information based on their focus. The 4-year-old, Dubai-based company
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xpanceo.com/newsroom/xpanceo-becomes-a-unicorn-with-250m-raise&quot;&gt;
     raised
    &lt;/a&gt;
    $250 million this summer at a $1.35 billion valuation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nothing-4537#overview&quot;&gt;
     Nothing
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a maker of Android smartphones, earbuds and watches, is another wearables developer, albeit not a pure-play in the space, with a big round of late. The startup closed on a $200 million
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://nothing.community/d/42158-nothing-raises-200m-series-c-to-power-the-next-phase-of-consumer-ai&quot;&gt;
     Series C
    &lt;/a&gt;
    last month to further its vision of an “AI-native platform in which hardware and software converge into a single intelligent system.” The company cited smart glasses as one of the devices in which it envisions incorporating its operating system.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    And while wearables is usually understood to be a category for humans, we did mix it up a bit in our list by including
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/halter&quot;&gt;
     Halter
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a maker of a platform that combines smart collars and virtual fencing for ranchers to manage their cattle. It
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250623397414/en/Halter-Raises-%24100M-in-Funding-to-Increase-Productivity-on-Cattle-Ranches&quot;&gt;
     closed on
    &lt;/a&gt;
    $100 million in Series D funding this summer at a $1 billion valuation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Health and medical conditions
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Wearables for monitoring medical conditions are also still drawing investors’ attention with two established names each picking up $100 million financings this year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    San Diego-based
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/biolinq#overview&quot;&gt;
     Biolinq
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which has developed a wearable biosensor that measures glucose levels continuously just beneath the skin’s surface, secured its $100 million round in March. A month earlier,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vital-connect#overview&quot;&gt;
     VitalConnect
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a San Jose, California-based maker of wearable, connected patches for remote monitoring of cardiac health, secured a round of the same size, led by
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ally-bridge-group&quot;&gt;
     Ally Bridge Group
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We’re also still seeing some varied startup activity around health-monitoring wearables. An offbeat one that caught our eye was
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/epicore-biosystems&quot;&gt;
     Epicore Biosystems
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which develops a wearable that tracks biomarkers in sweat to measure hydration, nutrition, stress and other physiological data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Deep-pocketed competition
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Being in an offbeat niche might provide considerable advantages to a startup. That’s because wearables startups play in a space that also happens to draw the largest technology companies in the world.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    From
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot;&gt;
     Apple
    &lt;/a&gt;

     AI glasses
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , giants with valuations in the trillions are finding appeal in the space. One of Apple’s newest offerings — AirPods with
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/123185&quot;&gt;
     live translation
    &lt;/a&gt;
    — shows the technological sophistication of wearables is only on the rise.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Even so, we’re betting startups will continue to find ways to innovate in ways that differentiate them from the tech giants. In particular, they have the advantage of marketing to a small initial early-adopter crowd and tweaking a product until it’s ripe for a much wider audience.

    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    This week offered a change of pace on the giant round front as it was a biotech company, rather than an AI startup, at the top of the ranks.
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kailera-therapeutics&quot;&gt;
     Kailera Therapeutics
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a developer of obesity therapeutics, led with a $600 million Series B. Other sizable financings went to companies offering fractional aircraft ownership, fintech services and hair loss treatments.

    $350 million in debt and equity funding. The financing consisted of $320 million in debt and equity from funds and accounts managed by

   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the period of Oct. 11-17. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

     &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Despite President
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/donald-trump&quot;&gt;
     Donald Trump
    &lt;/a&gt;
    recently imposing a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/business/h-1b-changes-startup-founder-impact-cost-o1-visa-entrepreneur-alternatives/&quot;&gt;
     $100,000 application fee
    &lt;/a&gt;
    on new H-1B visas, San Francisco remains a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfstandard.com/2024/11/19/ai-startup-founders-international-donald-trump/&quot;&gt;
     magnet
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for international AI founders keen to tap into the epicenter of innovation.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    I was one of those wide-eyed entrepreneurs back in 2017, when I first packed my bags and moved from my native Ukraine to SF to scale my startup,
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/animal-id-39d2&quot;&gt;
     Animal ID
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Unfortunately, I ended up returning home demoralized and depressed as my trip had led to so many rejections.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    However, I eventually realized that the problem wasn’t my tech — it was that I hadn’t understood the unspoken rules of Silicon Valley.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After spending years trying to break into the Valley, things finally turned around for me. Now, as a startup mentor at
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stanford-university&quot;&gt;
     Stanford University
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alchemist-accelerator&quot;&gt;
     Alchemist Accelerator
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , and founder of Raisable Founders Hub, I’ve made it my mission to help founders, especially immigrant entrepreneurs, avoid the unnecessary mistakes I made.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    My approach boils down to a few simple steps: shift your mindset, build a relevant network, validate your idea deeply, and then build your strategy. This is critical for founders navigating today’s funding frenzy.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Here’s what I wish I’d known when I first set foot in Silicon Valley:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Understand the principles by which the Valley lives
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Silicon Valley runs on trust, and trust is something that needs to be earned. Therefore, it’s best to start building it long before you arrive: Do your research and connect online with people you’d like to meet up with. Make sure you have something to offer. The Valley rewards those who contribute first.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Building a startup here is different from anywhere else due to extremely high costs, relentless competition and a generally much faster pace of doing things. All of this will test your adaptability — which is a key skill investors will be on the lookout for.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The right mindset can’t be bought, but it
    &lt;em&gt;
     can
    &lt;/em&gt;
    be developed by immersing yourself in the ecosystem and engaging with the right people.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Surround yourself with like-minded people
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Silicon Valley is filled with people who will challenge everything you do from day one. The people you surround yourself with can either fuel your growth or drain your momentum. Don’t waste time chasing generic networking opportunities. Instead:
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Be intentional.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Engage with communities that align with your mission — founders in your vertical, fellow immigrants, AI enthusiasts and so on, who are a few steps ahead of you and have already walked the path you are on, made their own mistakes, and know the best way forward.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Offer value first.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Share your expertise, contribute to discussions, and offer your participation or help at events. Don’t lead with an ask, lead with insight.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
     &lt;strong&gt;
      Engage smartly.
     &lt;/strong&gt;
     Attend events where meaningful conversations happen. Research speakers, ask sharp questions and follow up with genuine interest.
    &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The bottom line is: Focus on nurturing authentic connections that can flourish into long-term collaborations.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Ask for advice first, then intros
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Many founders obsess over getting investor introductions. But an intro without the right preparation is a wasted opportunity.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Instead of fixating on warm intros, focus on validating your ideas. Explain to everyone you meet how your solution solves a specific problem and why your team is the best to do it. Absorb their feedback and use it all as an opportunity to refine your pitch. Every discussion helps you understand how to frame your value proposition more effectively. Seek out great mentors. The best ones don’t give you answers — they help you ask better questions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Finally, not every interaction needs to lead to fundraising, the goal should be to build a sustainable company — so be open to any and all opportunities or connections that come your way. You never know, the next person you meet could become a future co-founder, adviser, customer or even a lifelong friend.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;hr/&gt;

<title> Cybersecurity Startup Investors Pulled Back In Q3 </title>

  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Cybersecurity Startup Investors Pulled Back In Q3&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/Cybersecurity-devices.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    After a lively first half of the year for cybersecurity startup funding, investors pulled back some in the third quarter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    In total, investors put just over $3.3 billion globally into seed- through growth-stage rounds for cybersecurity-focused companies, per Crunchbase data. That’s about a third lower than the prior quarter, a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/cybersecurity/privacy-venture-funding-surged-q2-2025-ai-cyera-data/&quot;&gt;
     robust period
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for dealmaking, but still about a third above year-ago levels.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Deal counts also declined sequentially in Q3, but still exceeded year-ago totals.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Megarounds of note
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As usual, much of the quarter’s fundraising tally came from a few big rounds.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For Q3, the largest round went to
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/honeywell-quantum-solutions&quot;&gt;
     Quantinuum
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a quantum computing unicorn that isn’t a pure-play cybersecurity company but does cite encryption and data protection among the core use cases for its technology. The Broomfield, Colorado-based company, which was spun out of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/honeywell&quot;&gt;
     Honeywell
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , closed a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/honeywell-quantum-solutions-series-b--04e457b8&quot;&gt;
     $600 million Series B
    &lt;/a&gt;
    in August led by
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nvidia&quot;&gt;
     Nvidia
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s venture arm.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The next-largest financing was a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/ontic-technologies-series-c--c9dd8cec&quot;&gt;
     $230 million Series C
    &lt;/a&gt;
    for Austin, Texas-based
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ontic-technologies#overview&quot;&gt;
     Ontic
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a provider of intelligence tools for corporate security. In third place was San Francisco-based
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vanta&quot;&gt;
     Vanta
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , an AI-enabled security and compliance platform that pulled in a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/vanta-series-d--927bf90e&quot;&gt;
     $150 million Series D
    &lt;/a&gt;
    .
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For a broader listing, below we ranked 10 of the largest cybersecurity-related financings of the quarter.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; data-load-mode=&quot;1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://e.infogram.com/6bad5481-7556-4a30-9b7c-60c7692022d3?src=embed&amp;embed_type=responsive_iframe&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Largest Cybersecurity-Related Rounds, Q3 2025-10/17/2025&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Exits
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The quarter also brought a couple good-sized startup exits of both the IPO and M&amp;A variety.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/netskope&quot;&gt;
     Netskope
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a cloud-security provider, delivered on the IPO front, raising more than $900 million in a well-received September
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/public/netskope-ipo-moves-higher-nasdaq-ntsk/&quot;&gt;
     debut
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Founded in 2012, the Santa Clara, California-based company previously raised $1.4 billion in early- through late-stage financing.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    As for acquisitions, the largest was Tokyo-based
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mitsubishi-electric&quot;&gt;
     Mitsubishi Electric
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s purchase of San Francisco-based
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nozomi-networks&quot;&gt;
     Nozomi Networks
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , a 12-year-old company focused on protecting critical infrastructure from cyber threats, in a deal reportedly valued at around $1 billion.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;
    Ups and downs
   &lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    So are these still bullish times for cybersecurity investment? While investment to the space was down sequentially this quarter, the drop does not appear sufficiently dramatic or prolonged to draw broad conclusions.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On public markets, major cybersecurity indexes continue to perform well, and, among newcomers, Netskope has held steady. So, that looks encouraging.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    On the M&amp;A side, we’re also still waiting for a final conclusion of
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google?_gl=1*14i3cvp*_gcl_au*ODY0MTMzNDQ2LjE3NTkxNTAxNDguMzMxODAwMzM4LjE3NjA0NjU0NDQuMTc2MDQ2NTQ0Mw..*_ga*MjAzODAwMzgwMi4xNzQzNDI5MzYx*_ga_97DKWJJNRK*czE3NjA2Mjg2MzAkbzg4MSRnMSR0MTc2MDYzMDE0NSRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;&gt;
     Google
    &lt;/a&gt;
    ’s planned $32 billion acquisition of cybersecurity provider
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wiz-inc&quot;&gt;
     Wiz
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , announced in March. If the deal passes regulatory muster and closes, it would rank as the largest startup acquisition to date and mark another upbeat development for the security sector.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    For now, we’ll keep an eye out to see if there are any stronger headwinds portending a shift in direction for the space.

<title> Deel Lands $300M At $17.3B Valuation Amid Spying Saga, Uptick In HR Software Funding </title>

  &lt;img data-pin-description=&quot;Deel Lands $300M At $17.3B Valuation Amid Spying Saga, Uptick In HR Software Funding&quot; src=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/business-strategy.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;!-- END .ss-inline-share-wrapper --&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    HR and payroll platform
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deel&quot;&gt;
     Deel
    &lt;/a&gt;
    has raised $300 million in fresh funding at a $17.3 billion valuation. The deal was led by new investor
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ribbit-capital&quot;&gt;
     Ribbit Capital
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and previous investors
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz&quot;&gt;
     Andreessen Horowitz
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coatue&quot;&gt;
     Coatue Management
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Other investors including
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/general-catalyst-partners&quot;&gt;
     General Catalyst
    &lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/green-bay-ventures&quot;&gt;
     Green Bay Ventures
    &lt;/a&gt;
    also participated.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    The round for New York-based Deel comes as funding for HR tech startups
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/ai-hr-software-startup-funding-ma/&quot;&gt;
     overall has seen an uptick this year
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Through mid-September, HR software startups globally have raised $1.9 billion in venture funding this year, per Crunchbase
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/discover/saved/global-funding-to-human-resources/d1ead32c-16be-4fa7-b75a-bc3b7cbf4fd7&quot;&gt;
     data
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . That’s just under the $2 billion raised by such startups in all of 2024. U.S.-based human resources software startups have raised a combined $1.2 billion, up from the $1.1 billion raised last year.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Still, this year’s figures are a far cry from 2021’s banner figures, when startups in the sector raised $10.5 billion globally, per Crunchbase data.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Deel’s new round also follows
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semafor.com/article/06/04/2025/deel-fires-back-at-competitor-rippling-with-new-spying-allegations&quot;&gt;
     an ugly and closely watched corporate espionage scandal
    &lt;/a&gt;
    between Deel and rival
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rippling&quot;&gt;
     Rippling
    &lt;/a&gt;
    , which itself raised
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rippling-series-g--66f6f0d8&quot;&gt;
     a $450 million Series G round
    &lt;/a&gt;
    at a $16.8 billion valuation earlier this year, despite the drama.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Investors were apparently more interested in Deel’s business metrics than the Rippling saga. Deel said it posted $100 million in revenue last month for the first time, and closed out its third consecutive year of profitability. It hit $1 billion in ARR earlier this year and says it now counts more than 37,000 businesses as customers, processing $22 billion in payroll a year.
