 &lt;p&gt;
  Social community platform Discord is preparing to require users to verify their age by the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/discord-delays-global-rollout-of-age-verification-after-backlash/&quot;&gt;
   second half of 2026
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , and users are concerned about the privacy of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/discord-to-roll-out-age-verification-next-month-for-full-access-to-its-platform/&quot;&gt;
   uploading a government ID or face scan
  &lt;/a&gt;
  to the network. While users can still access most features without verification, many remain uneasy giving more information to a company that suffered a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/discord-suffers-data-breach-impacting-at-least-70000-users/&quot;&gt;
   breach
  &lt;/a&gt;
  last year that exposed the IDs of around 70,000 users.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For some users, this is motivation enough to seek out alternative platforms that prioritize security, privacy, or simply offer a different experience. Here’s a look at the most promising Discord alternatives, from open-source and secure options to voice-first platforms built for hardcore gamers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Stoat
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Stoat-platform.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w&quot; width=&quot;680&quot;/&gt;

    Stoat
   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://stoat.chat/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Stoat
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (formerly Revolt) stands out as the closest Discord alternative in both design and usability. As an open-source project, it gives users more control over their data and appeals to those who value privacy and transparency. Overall, the platform is fairly easy for Discord users to pick up, offering similar text and voice channels as well as community servers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, Stoat is a relatively new platform (launched in 2021), and still faces growing pains. Recently, it experienced
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.stoat.chat/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   server capacity issues
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and the occasional lag during user surges. Feature support isn’t yet on par with Discord’s, and onboarding can be slow at times, especially when the platform’s popularity spikes. For those willing to trade a bit of stability for increased privacy, though, Stoat could be worth a try.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Element
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=300,294 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=768,753 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=680,667 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=430,421 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=720,706 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=900,882 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=800,784 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=668,655 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=383,375 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=629,617 629w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=542,531 542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Elementio.png?resize=50,50 50w&quot; width=&quot;680&quot;/&gt;

    Element
   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For users who prioritize privacy and control above all else,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://element.io/en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Element
  &lt;/a&gt;
  offers a compelling alternative. Built on the decentralized Matrix protocol, Element enables users to self-host servers, maintain end-to-end encryption, and federate with other Matrix-based services. This ensures that no single company controls your data.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While the setup and interface require a bit more technical savvy than Discord’s, Element is a good choice for users who value secure, decentralized communication.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  TeamSpeak
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; height=&quot;383&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; sizes=&quot;auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?w=680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TeamSpeak.png?resize=50,28 50w&quot; width=&quot;680&quot;/&gt;

    TeamSpeak
   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If your primary need is high-quality, low-latency voice chat,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teamspeak.com/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   TeamSpeak
  &lt;/a&gt;
  is the best alternative to Discord. While it remains popular among competitive gamers for its superior audio and private server hosting, its text chat and media sharing are quite basic. It’s also missing built-in video calls as well as emojis and gifs. So if you don’t mind not having as many features, it’s great for voice-centric groups that don’t need all the bells and whistles.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Similar to Stoat, TeamSpeak has experienced a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/teamspeak/status/2023443122676502941?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   surge in new users
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , prompting the platform to expand its hosting capacity. In February, TeamSpeak introduced two new regions for community creation: “Frankfurt 3” and “Toronto 1.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Mumble
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mumble.info/downloads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Mumble
  &lt;/a&gt;
  is a free, open-source voice chat application. Like TeamSpeak, it provides high-quality, low-latency audio and allows users to host and customize their own servers. However, its interface is outdated and lacks some of the features found in Discord, making it more ideal for hardcore gamers focused on voice chat rather than community building through video calls, media sharing, or screen sharing.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Discourse
 &lt;/h2&gt;

    Discourse
   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Those who prefer long-form, organized discussions over rapid-fire chat may find
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discourse.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Discourse
  &lt;/a&gt;
  more appealing. As an open-source forum platform, Discourse supports threaded discussions, making it ideal for educational groups, professional teams, and communities that value in-depth conversation. However, users looking for instant messaging, voice, and casual group chats may find it less familiar than Discord.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Slack, Microsoft Teams, Signal, or WhatsApp
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Other notable mentions include Slack and Microsoft Teams, which serve well for professional and productivity-focused communication.
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/signal-gets-new-video-call-features-making-it-a-viable-alternative-to-zoom-meet-and-teams/&quot;&gt;
   Signal
  &lt;/a&gt;
  is also a top choice for those who want end-to-end
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-encrypted-messaging-apps/&quot;&gt;
   encryption and privacy
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . Meanwhile, WhatsApp also offers free messaging and group voice calls, though it’s not designed for gaming or large communities.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  What to know about age verification on Discord
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Discord recently announced that it will soon implement age verification measures aimed at creating a safer environment, particularly for its younger users. This initiative is designed to ensure users meet the necessary age requirements to access certain features and communities on the platform. Users may be required to verify their age through various methods, which could involve submitting an ID, completing a facial age estimation, or using a credit card.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  By default, all users will experience a “teen-appropriate” setting, and only those verified as adults will have the ability to modify certain settings or access age-restricted content. Adults will be required to verify their status to unblur sensitive content and to access channels and servers designated for an older audience.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After recent backlash, Discord
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/discord-delays-global-rollout-of-age-verification-after-backlash/&quot;&gt;
   postponed the official launch
  &lt;/a&gt;
  to the latter half of 2026, adding that 90% of users will not require age verification and can continue using the platform without changes, as many users do not engage with age-restricted content. The platform initially planned to roll out age verification in March.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  Prediction market users have made — and profited from — big bets around the bombing of Iran by the U.S. and Israeli military.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On Polymarket, $529 million was traded on contracts tied to the timing of the attack,

  . An analysis by analytics firm Bubblemaps SA found that six newly-created accounts made a profit of $1 million by correctly betting that the U.S. would strike Iran by February 28 — behavior that could indicate insider trading.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The bets might merely reflect broader speculation about U.S. intentions in Iran, but Bubblemaps CEO Nicolas Vaiman said the circulation of information “involving war or conflict,” coupled with Polymarket’s anonymity, “can create incentives for informed participants to act early.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Back in January, analytics firm Polysights also
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Polysights/status/2027772191895343401?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   noted
  &lt;/a&gt;
  an apparent spike in bets around the likelihood that Iran’s now-deceased Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would no longer hold that role by the end of March.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Responding to concerns that such bets might essentially place a financial incentive on assassination,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/2027924240926638323&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour said
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , “We don’t list markets directly tied to death. When there are markets where potential outcomes involve death, we design the rules to prevent people from profiting from death.” He added that Kalshi would reimburse all fees from these bets.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  As persistent spam complaints have clouded Google’s Rich Communication Services (RCS) push in India, the company is turning to deeper carrier integration to bolster protections on the platform.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On Sunday, Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator with over 463 million subscribers, said it had partnered with Google to integrate the carrier’s network-level spam filtering into the RCS ecosystem in the country. The move is aimed at strengthening protections against unwanted messages and fraud on the platform, the companies said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  India has
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truecaller.com/blog/insights/indias-spam-shield-truecaller-2025-report&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   emerged as a particularly challenging market
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for spam and fraud across messaging channels, driven by the country’s vast mobile user base, rapid growth in digital payments, and aggressive enterprise marketing practices. In 2022, complaints about unsolicited ads on Google’s RCS — delivered primarily through the Google Messages app — were significant enough to prompt the company to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/04/google-disables-rcs-ads-in-india-following-rampant-spam-by-businesses/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   temporarily pause business promotions
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on the platform in India. However, some users
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/aamirsidd94/status/1827974139010748641&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   continue to report frustration
  &lt;/a&gt;
  with spam messages on Google Messages, suggesting the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Soumya_Nicky/status/2014050735999041555&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   issue has not fully abated
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Airtel said it had been cautious about deeper alignment with Google’s RCS until traffic could be routed through its own spam controls, highlighting carrier concerns about rising fraud risks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “We had not onboarded Google because we first wanted RCS messages to be routed through the Airtel spam filter,” an Airtel spokesperson said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Under the partnership, Airtel’s network intelligence will be combined with Google’s RCS platform to enable real-time checks on business messaging, including sender verification, spam detection, and enforcement of users’ do-not-disturb preferences. Airtel described the move as a “global first” for integrating a telecom operator’s spam filtering directly into an over-the-top messaging platform, though the companies did not provide comparative details.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “We are committed to continuing to work with the broader ecosystem of carriers to create a consistent and trusted messaging experience for RCS users around the world,” Sameer Samat, president of Android ecosystem at Google, said in a statement. The comment signals the company may look to extend the model beyond India as it works to standardize security across the RCS ecosystem.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  India represents a critical market for Google’s messaging ambitions, with more than a billion internet users and over 700 million smartphone users. The country is also home to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/whatsapp-users-by-country&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   over 853 million WhatsApp users
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , according to World Population Review, underlining the scale of competition in mobile messaging.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Prabhu Ram, vice president for the industry research group at CyberMedia Research, said the deeper carrier integration reflects efforts to plug longstanding weaknesses in rich messaging ecosystems that have been vulnerable to spam and fraud.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “The efficacy of this partnership should be reflected in metrics such as reductions in spam volume, user complaints, and fraud incidence, as well as improvements in engagement with legitimate messages,” Ram told TechCrunch.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Airtel has been
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/airtel-taps-ai-to-combat-india-rampant-spam-calls-problem/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   stepping up its anti-spam efforts
  &lt;/a&gt;
  over the past year, saying its AI-led systems have blocked more than 71 billion spam calls and 2.9 billion spam messages, helping drive a nearly 69% drop in fraud-related financial losses on its network.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  More broadly, Google has been positioning RCS as the successor to SMS, saying in May 2025 that the standard was handling
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/google-announces-1b-rcs-messages-sent-in-the-u-s-daily/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   more than a billion messages daily in the U.S.
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , based on a 28-day average.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Google did not say whether similar carrier integrations are planned for other markets or provide estimates for how much the move could reduce spam and fraud.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  Investors have been pouring billions into AI companies over the past few years, as the technology continues to hold sway in the Valley and thus the world. But not all AI companies are grabbing investor attention.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Indeed, even as it seems every company these days is rebranding to include “AI” in its name, some startup ideas are just no longer in favor with investors. TechCrunch spoke with VCs to learn what investors aren’t looking for in AI software-as-a-service startups anymore.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Popular SaaS categories for investors now include startups building AI-native infrastructure, vertical SaaS with proprietary data, systems of action (those helping users complete tasks), and platforms deeply embedded in mission-critical workflows, according to Aaron Holiday, a managing partner at 645 Ventures.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But he also gave a list of companies that are considered quite boring to investors these days: Startups building thin workflow layers, generic horizontal tools, light product management, and surface-level analytics — basically, anything an AI agent can now do.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Abdul Abdirahman, an investor at the firm F Prime, added that generic vertical software “without proprietary data moats” is no longer popular, and Igor Ryabenky, a founder and managing partner at AltaIR Capital, went deeper on that point. He said investors aren’t interested in anything, really, that doesn’t have much product depth.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “If your differentiation lives mostly in UI [user interface] and automation, that’s no longer enough,” he said. “The barrier to entry has dropped, which makes building a real moat much harder.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  New companies entering the market now need to build around “real workflow ownership and a clear understanding of the problem from day one,” he said.  “Massive codebases are no longer an advantage. What matters more is speed, focus, and the ability to adapt quickly. Pricing also needs to be flexible: rigid per-seat models will be harder to defend, while consumption-based models make more sense in this environment.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Jake Saper, a general partner at Emergence Capital, also had thoughts on ownership. To him, the differences between Cursor and Claude Code are the “canary in the coal mine.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “One owns the developer’s workflow, the other just executes the task,” Saper continued. “Developers are increasingly choosing the execution over process.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  He said any product dealing with “workflow stickiness” — meaning trying to attract as many human customers as possible to continuously use the product — might find themselves in an uphill battle as agents takeover the workflow.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Pre-Claude, getting humans to do their jobs inside your software was a powerful moat, but if agents are doing the work, who cares about human workflow?” he told TechCrunch.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  He also thinks integrations are becoming less popular, especially as Anthropic’s model context protocol (MCP) makes it easier than ever to connect AI models to external data and systems. This means someone doesn’t need to download multiple integrations or build their own customer integrations; they can just use the MCP.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Being the connector used to be a moat,” Saper said. “Soon, it’ll be a utility.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Also, no longer en vogue include the “workflow automation and task management tools that enable the coordination of human work become less necessary if, over time, agents just execute the tasks,” Abdirahman said, citing examples, mainly public SaaS companies whose stocks are down as new AI-native startups arise with better, more efficient technology.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Ryabenky said the SaaS companies struggling to raise right now are the ones that can easily be replicated, he said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Generic productivity tools, project management software, basic CRM clones, and thin AI wrappers built on top of existing APIs fall into this category,” he said. “If the product is mostly an interface layer without deep integration, proprietary data, or embedded process knowledge, strong AI-native teams can rebuild it quickly. That is what makes investors cautious.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Overa, what remains attractive about SaaS is depth and expertise, with tools embedded in critical workflows. He said companies should right now look into integrating AI deeply into their products and update their marketing to reflect that, Ryabenky continued.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Investors are reallocating capital toward businesses that own workflows, data, and domain expertise,”  Ryabenky said. “And away from products that can be copied without much effort.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  By CEO Sam Altman’s own admission, OpenAI’s deal with the Department of Defense was “definitely rushed,” and “the optics don’t look good.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/&quot;&gt;
   negotiations between Anthropic and the Pentagon fell through
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on Friday, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to stop using Anthropic’s technology after
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/iran-strikes-2026/card/u-s-strikes-in-middle-east-use-anthropic-hours-after-trump-ban-ozNO0iClZpfpL7K7ElJ2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   a six-month transition period
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he was designating the AI company as a supply-chain risk.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Then,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/openais-sam-altman-announces-pentagon-deal-with-technical-safeguards/&quot;&gt;
   OpenAI quickly announced
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that it had reached a deal of its own for models to be deployed in classified environments. With Anthropic saying it was drawing red lines around the use of its technology in fully autonomous weapons or mass domestic surveillance, and Altman saying OpenAI had the same red lines, there were some obvious questions: Was OpenAI being honest about its safeguards? Why was it able to reach a deal while Anthropic was not?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  So as OpenAI executives defended the agreement on social media, the company also published
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/index/our-agreement-with-the-department-of-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   a blog post outlining its approach
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In fact, the post pointed to three areas where it said OpenAI’s models cannot be used — mass domestic surveillance, autonomous weapon systems, and “high-stakes automated decisions (e.g. systems such as ‘social credit’).”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company said that in contrast to other AI companies that have “reduced or removed their safety guardrails and relied primarily on usage policies as their primary safeguards in national security deployments,” OpenAI’s agreement protects its red lines “through a more expansive, multi-layered approach.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “We retain full discretion over our safety stack, we deploy via cloud, cleared OpenAI personnel are in the loop, and we have strong contractual protections,” the blog said. “This is all in addition to the strong existing protections in U.S. law.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company added, “We don’t know why Anthropic could not reach this deal, and we hope that they and more labs will consider it.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After the post was published,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/masnick.com/post/3mfxyktqgyp24&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Techdirt’s Mike Masnick claimed
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that the deal “absolutely does allow for domestic surveillance,” because it says the collection of private data will comply with
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/meet-executive-order-12333-the-reagan-rule-that-lets-the-nsa-spy-on-americans/2014/07/18/93d2ac22-0b93-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Executive Order 12333
  &lt;/a&gt;
  (along with a number of other laws). Masnick described that order as “how the NSA hides its domestic surveillance by capturing communications by tapping into lines *outside the US* even if it contains info from/on US persons.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/katrinaemmons_our-agreement-with-the-department-of-war-activity-7433627924815163392-hMRw/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   a LinkedIn post
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , OpenAI’s head of national security partnerships Katrina Mulligan argued that much of the discussion around the contract language assumes “the only thing standing between Americans and the use of AI for mass domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons is a single usage policy provision in a single contract with the Department of War.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “That’s not how any of this works,” Mulligan said, adding, “Deployment architecture matters more than contract language […] By limiting our deployment to cloud API, we can ensure that our models cannot be integrated directly into weapons systems, sensors, or other operational hardware.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Altman also fielded questions about the deal on X, where he
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/sama/status/2027911640256286973&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   admitted it had been rushed
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and resulted in significant backlash against OpenAI (to the extent that
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/01/anthropics-claude-rises-to-no-2-in-the-app-store-following-pentagon-dispute/&quot;&gt;
   Anthropic’s Claude overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT in Apple’s App Store
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on Saturday). So why do it?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “We really wanted to de-escalate things, and we thought the deal on offer was good,” Altman said. “If we are right and this does lead to a de-escalation between the DoW and the industry, we will look like geniuses, and a company that took on a lot of pain to do things to help the industry. If not, we will continue to be characterized as […] rushed and uncareful.”

 &lt;p&gt;
  Honor first teased its “Robot phone” with a movable camera arm earlier this year. Ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, the Chinese company provided more details about the device, including how the robot can respond to different situations without commands. The company said that it is planning to launch this device in the second half of this year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Honor said that the robot also has a “personality” and can respond to you with “head shakes” and can also dance to the beat of music. The company noted that users can talk to the assistant on the phone through text and voice. Honor showed a video of a person asking for apparel suggestions, and the robot nodding or shaking to suggest an outfit.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The phone has a 200-megapixel camera on a moving robot three-axis gimbal with stabilization tech. The company said that the camera can smoothly rotate around and capture smooth videos and photos. It also has a Super Steady mode for video capture. The company said the phone can get cinematic shots through its Spinshot feature that makes the robot camera rotate by 90 or 180 degrees.
 &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The robotic camera also allows for more fluid video calls that can track you through AI-powered object tracking. The tech is like Apple’s Center Stage on steroids if it works.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company said that it developed its own micro motor to control the robotic camera’s movements. It noted that it used some techniques used in foldable phones to make the camera more sturdy and fit the four-degree-of-freedom gimbal system into the body of a phone. Honor said that it is using the same materials for the robotic arm as the Honor Magic V6’s hinge, with 2800 MPa tensile strength.
 &lt;/p&gt;

   Honor
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Honor launched its new foldable, the Honor Magic V6, with a massive 6,600 mAh battery and a new sturdy hinge ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Chinese company has been obsessed with proving that it makes the thinnest foldables. This year’s version is 4mm thick when unfolded and 8.75 mm thick when folded. Compared to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/honors-slim-magic-v5-foldable-is-fun-to-use-minus-the-huge-camera-bump/&quot;&gt;
   last year’s Magic V5
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , which was 4.1 mm thick when unfolded and 8.8 mm thick when folded. We are talking very thin shavings here, but that helps the company make those claims.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The battery is possibly one of the most impressive parts of the phone. The Honor Magic V6 has a 6,600 mAh battery, up from 5,820 mAh last year. Using Honor’s SuperCharge tech, the phone can charge at 80W through a wired connection, and at 66W wirelessly.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  What’s more, Honor also showed a new Silicon-carbon battery tech with 32% silicon density that could push foldable phone battery over 7,000 mAh.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The new device has a 7.95-inch main AMOLED display with 2352 x 2172 pixel resolution and a 6.52-inch cover display with 2420 x 1080 pixel resolution. Both screens support LTPO 2.0, which means they can switch to variable refresh rates between 1-120Hz for different use cases for better content legibility and power saving.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company said that it has worked on a new Super Steel Hinge with a tensile strength of 2,800 MPa, which would make for sturdy long-term usage. It also said that it has reduced the crease depth by 44%, making the display look smooth. Honor noted that the Magic V6 has a new anti-reflective coating for the external screen with a reflectivity rating of 1.5%.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The phone is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, has 16GB RAM, and 512GB of storage. The Magic V6 has three rear cameras: a 50-megapixel main camera with f/1.6 aperture, a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with f/2.5 aperture, and a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera with f/2.2 aperture. On the front, there are dual 20-megapixel cameras with an f/2.2 aperture.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Honor is taking efforts to make the device have file and notification sharing compatibility with Apple devices. For instance, with Honor Magic V6, you can set up a two-way notification sync with an iPhone. Plus, the device also has settings to display notifications on the Apple Watch. The foldable has the ability share files with Macs with one tap, and it can act as an extended display as well.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Honor didn’t specify pricing for the device, but said that the Magic V6 will be released in select international markets in the second half of the year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

  Anthropic’s chatbot Claude seems to have benefited from the attention around the company’s fraught negotiations with the Pentagon.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/28/anthropics-claude-apple-apps.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   first reported by CNBC
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Claude has been rising to the top of the free app rankings in Apple’s US App Store. On Saturday evening, it overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT to claim the number one spot, a position that it still held on Sunday morning.
 &lt;/p&gt;

  , Claude was just outside the top 100 at the end of January, and has spent most of February somewhere in the top 20. It’s climbed rapidly in the past few days, from sixth on Wednesday, then fourth on Thursday, then first on Saturday.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  A company spokesperson said that daily signups have broken the all-time record every day this week, free users have increased more than 60% since January, and paid subscribers have more than doubled this year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After Anthropic attempted to negotiate for safeguards preventing the Department of Defense from using its AI models for mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to stop using all Anthropic products and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he’s

  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;

  OpenAI subsequently
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/openais-sam-altman-announces-pentagon-deal-with-technical-safeguards/&quot;&gt;
   announced its own agreement with the Pentagon
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , which CEO Sam Altman claimed includes safeguards related to domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  One day not long ago, a founder texted his investor with an update: he was replacing his entire customer service team with Claude Code, an AI tool that can write and deploy software on its own. To Lex Zhao, an investor at One Way Ventures, the message indicated something bigger — the moment when companies like Salesforce stopped being the automatic default.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “The barriers to entry for creating software are so low now thanks to coding agents, that the build versus buy decision is shifting toward build in so many cases,” Zhao told TechCrunch.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The build versus buy shift is only part of the problem. The whole idea of using AI agents instead of people to perform work throws into question the SaaS business model itself. SaaS companies currently price their software per seat — meaning by how many employees log in to use it. “SaaS has long been regarded as one of the most attractive business models due to its highly predictable recurring revenue, immense scalability, and 70-90% gross margins,” Abdul Abdirahman, an investor at the venture firm F-Prime, told TechCrunch.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  When one, or a handful, of AI agents can do that work — when employees simply ask their AI of choice to pull the data from the system — that per-seat model starts to break down.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The rapid pace of AI development also means that new tools, like Claude Code or OpenAI’s Codex, can replicate not just the core functions of SaaS products but also the add-on tools a SaaS vendor would sell to grow revenue from existing customers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On top of that, customers now have the ultimate contract negotiation tool in their pockets: If they don’t like a SaaS vendor’s prices, they can, more easily than ever before, build their own alternative. “Even if they do not take the build route, this creates downward pressure on contracts that SaaS vendors can secure during renewals,” Abdirahman continued.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  We saw this as early as late 2024, when Klarna announced that it had ditched
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/klarna-ceo-doubts-that-other-companies-will-replace-salesforce-with-ai/&quot;&gt;
   Salesforce’s flagship CRM product
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in favor of its own homegrown AI system. The realization that a growing number of other companies can do the same is spooking public markets, where the stock prices of SaaS giants like Salesforce and Workday have been sliding. In early February, an investor sell-off wiped nearly
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/global-software-stocks-hit-by-anthropic-wake-up-call-ai-disruption-2026-02-04/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   $1 trillion in market value
  &lt;/a&gt;
  from software and services stocks, followed by
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/us/business-us/article/us-market-panic-mass-job-losses-from-ai-xw57g5l8g?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdg-fPMd_bdQrTZm2OPnVJ5Gd7hg7CvhpTV9HzaOFJFBedw5_jXUL39c-i_3gs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69a04089&amp;gaa_sig=OcQDTGEvAK6Sqh2UYAxYUlZonW-rZrCxWxOdxcCoxaM_lpwsPS12sZkgmltjwiBAGWd9jfwE3V4GyaqKc4o-4Q%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   another billion later
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in the month.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Experts are calling it the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-this-isnt-our-first-saaspocalypse/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   SaaSpocalypse
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , with one analyst dubbing it FOBO investing —
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/86b5591a-9e62-4c3f-9e03-7d90d36ed068&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   or fear of becoming obsolete
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Yet the venture investors TechCrunch spoke with believe such fears are only temporary.  “This isn’t the death of SaaS,” Aaron Holiday, a managing partner at 645 Ventures, told TechCrunch. Rather, it’s the beginning of an old snake shedding its skin, he said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Move fast, break SaaS
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/claude-ai-tools-tech-selloff-software-apocalypse-cybersecurity-anthropic-ibm-2026-2&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   public market pattern
  &lt;/a&gt;
  is best illustrated through Anthropic’s recent product launches. The company released Claude Code for cybersecurity, and related stocks dropped. It released legal tools in Claude Cowork AI, and the stock price of the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF  — a basket of publicly traded software companies that includes firms like LegalZoom and RELX — also dropped.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In some ways, this was expected, as SaaS companies had long been overvalued, investors said. It also doesn’t help that these companies did the bulk of their growing during the zero-interest-rate era, which has since ended. The cost of doing business rises when the cost of borrowing money increases.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Public market investors typically price SaaS companies by estimating future revenue. But there is no telling whether in one year or five years anyone will be using SaaS products to the extent they once did. That’s why every time a new advanced AI tool launches, SaaS stocks feel a tremor.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “This may be the first time in history that the terminal value of software is being fundamentally questioned, materially reshaping how SaaS companies are underwritten going forward,” Abdirahman said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  That’s because slapping AI features on top of existing SaaS products may not be enough. A horde of AI-native startups is
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/more-startups-are-hitting-10m-arr-in-3-months-than-ever-before/&quot;&gt;
   rising at a record pace
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , having completely redefined what it means to be a software company.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Software is now easier and cheaper to build, meaning it’s easier to replicate, Yoni Rechtman, a partner at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  That’s good news for the next generation of startups, but bad news for the incumbents that spent years building their tech stacks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On the other hand, the market also lacks enough time and evidence to show that whatever new business model emerges the SaaS’s wake will be worthwhile. AI companies are sometimes pricing their models based on consumption, meaning customers pay based on how much AI they use, measured in tokens (which each model provider defines slightly differently).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Others are working on “outcome-based pricing,” where fees are charged based on how well the AI actually works. This, ironically, is the current approach of former Salesforce CEO Bret Taylor’s AI startup, Sierra, a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sierra.ai/blog/outcome-based-pricing-for-ai-agents&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   quasi-Salesforce competitor
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that offers customer service agents.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The approach appears, so far, appears to be working. In November,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/bret-taylors-sierra-reaches-100m-arr-in-under-two-years/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Sierra hit $100 million
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in annual recurring revenue in less than two years.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There was once also the idea that cloud-based software like SaaS sells would never depreciate and that it could last for decades. This is still true in some ways compared to what came before — on-premises software, which companies had to install and maintain on their own servers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But being in the cloud doesn’t protect SaaS vendors from an entirely new technology rising to compete: AI.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Investors are rightfully nervous as AI-native companies pop up, adapt, adopt, and build technology much faster than a traditional SaaS company can move. SaaS companies are, after all, themselves the incumbents, having replaced old-school on-premises vendors in the last era of disruption.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This SaaSpocalypse calls to mind that Taylor Swift lyric about what happens when “someone else lights up the room” because “people love an ingénue.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “The most important thing to understand about the SaaS pullback is that it is simultaneously a real structural shift and potentially a market overreaction,” Abdirahman said, adding that investors typically “sell first and ask questions later.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  SaaS IPOs are on hold
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Public-market SaaS companies aren’t the only ones feeling a chill from investors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  A Crunchbase report released Wednesday showed that, though
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/public/ipos-up-saas-debuts-down-early-2026/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   the IPO market seems to be thawing for some sectors
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , there haven’t been — and aren’t expected to be — any venture-backed SaaS filings on the horizon.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Holiday said this may be because there is a lot of pressure on large, private, late-stage SaaS companies like Canva and Rippling given the persnickety IPO window, high expectations driven by AI advancements, and the unsteady stock price of already public SaaS companies.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Some of these companies, including mid-size SaaS companies, have even struggled to raise extension rounds in the private market, Holiday said, over the same fears public investors have.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Nobody wants to be subjected to the volatility of public markets when sentiment can send companies into downward tailspins,” Rechtman said, adding he expects to see companies like these to stay private for much longer.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, the public market waits to get a good look at the finances of the first AI-native companies hoping to IPO. The scuttlebutt says that both
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/openai-reportedly-finalizing-100b-deal-at-more-than-850b-valuation/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   OpenAI
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/anthropic-hires-lawyers-as-it-preps-for-ipo/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Anthropic
  &lt;/a&gt;
  are contemplating IPOs, maybe even later this year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The most likely outcome is something that weaves the old and the new together, as tech disruptions always have.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Holiday said most of the new features companies are toying with these days “won’t stick” and that enterprises will always need software that meets compliance regulations, supports audits, manages workflow, and offers durability.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Durable shareholder value isn’t built on hype,” he continued. “It’s built on fundamentals, retention, margins, real budgets, and defensibility.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Friday afternoon, just as this interview was getting underway, a news alert flashed across my computer screen: the Trump administration was severing ties with Anthropic, the San Francisco AI company founded in 2021 by Dario Amodei and other former OpenAI researchers who left over safety concerns. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had invoked a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/&quot;&gt;
   national security law
  &lt;/a&gt;
  —  one designed to counter foreign supply chain threats —  to blacklist the company from doing business with the Pentagon after Amodei refused to allow Anthropic’s tech to be used for mass surveillance of U.S. citizens or for autonomous armed drones that could select and kill targets without human input.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It was a jaw-dropping sequence. Anthropic is now set to lose a contract worth up to $200 million, as well as be barred from working with other defense contractors after President Trump posted on Truth Social directing every federal agency to “immediately cease all use of Anthropic technology.” (Anthropic has since said it will
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   challenge the Pentagon in court
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , calling the supply-chain-risk designation legally unsound and “never before publicly applied to an American company.”)
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Max Tegmark has spent the better part of a decade warning that the race to build ever-more-powerful AI systems is outpacing the world’s ability to govern them. The Swedish-American physicist and professor at MIT founded the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureoflife.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Future of Life Institute
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in 2014. In 2023, he famously helped organize an
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   open letter
  &lt;/a&gt;
  — ultimately signed by more than 33,000 people, including Elon Musk — calling for a pause in advanced AI development.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  His view of the Anthropic crisis is unsparing: the company, like its rivals, has sown the seeds of its own predicament. Tegmark’s argument doesn’t begin with the Pentagon but with a decision made years earlier — a choice, shared across the industry, to resist binding regulation. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and others have long promised to govern themselves responsibly. Earlier this week, Anthropic even dropped the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-changing-safety-policy-2026-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   central tenet of its own safety pledge
  &lt;/a&gt;
  — its promise not to release increasingly powerful AI systems until the company was confident they wouldn’t cause harm.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Now, in the absence of rules, there’s not a lot to protect these players, says Tegmark. Here’s more from that interview, edited for length and clarity. You can hear the full conversation this coming week on TechCrunch’s
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/76SeToo8Rxj8hRTE0iQwWZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   StrictlyVC Download
  &lt;/a&gt;
  podcast.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   When you saw this news just now about Anthropic, what was your first reaction?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It’s so interesting to think back a decade ago, when people were so excited about how we were going to make artificial intelligence to cure cancer, to grow the prosperity in America and make America strong. And here we are now where the U.S. government is pissed off at this company for not wanting AI to be used for domestic mass surveillance of Americans, and also not wanting to have killer robots that can autonomously — without any human input at all — decide who gets killed.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Anthropic has staked its entire identity on being a safety-first AI company, and yet it was collaborating with defense and intelligence agencies [dating back to at least 2024]. Do you think that’s at all contradictory?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It is contradictory. If I can give a little cynical take on this — yes, Anthropic has been very good at marketing themselves as all about safety. But if you actually look at the facts rather than the claims, what you see is that Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind and xAI have all talked a lot about how they care about safety. None of them has come out supporting binding safety regulation the way we have in other industries. And all four of these companies have now broken their own promises. First we had Google — this big slogan, ‘Don’t be evil.’ Then they dropped that. Then they dropped another longer commitment that basically said they promised not to do harm with AI. They dropped that so they could sell AI for surveillance and weapons. OpenAI just dropped the word safety from their mission statement. xAI shut down their whole safety team. And now Anthropic, earlier in the week, dropped their most important safety commitment — the promise not to release powerful AI systems until they were sure they weren’t going to cause harm.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   How did companies that made such prominent safety commitments end up in this position?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  All of these companies, especially OpenAI and Google DeepMind but to some extent also Anthropic, have persistently lobbied against regulation of AI, saying, ‘Just trust us, we’re going to regulate ourselves.’ And they’ve successfully lobbied. So we right now have less regulation on AI systems in America than on sandwiches. You know, if you want to open a sandwich shop and the health inspector finds 15 rats in the kitchen, he won’t let you sell any sandwiches until you fix it. But if you say, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not going to sell sandwiches, I’m going to sell AI girlfriends for 11-year-olds, and they’ve been linked to suicides in the past, and then I’m going to release something called superintelligence which might overthrow the U.S. government, but I have a good feeling about mine’ — the inspector has to say, ‘Fine, go ahead, just don’t sell sandwiches.’
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   There’s food safety regulation and no AI regulation.
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  And this, I feel, all of these companies really share the blame for. Because if they had taken all these promises that they made back in the day for how they were going to be so safe and goody-goody, and gotten together, and then gone to the government and said, ‘Please take our voluntary commitments and turn them into U.S. law that binds even our most sloppy competitors’ — this would have happened instead. We’re in a complete regulatory vacuum. And we know what happens when there’s a complete corporate amnesty: you get
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/woman-who-stood-between-america-and-epidemic-birth-defects-180963165/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   thalidomide
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , you get tobacco companies pushing cigarettes on kids, you get asbestos causing lung cancer. So it’s sort of ironic that their own resistance to having laws saying what’s okay and not okay to do with AI is now coming back and biting them.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  There is no law right now against building AI to kill Americans, so the government can just suddenly ask for it. If the companies themselves had earlier come out and said, ‘We want this law,’ they wouldn’t be in this pickle. They really shot themselves in the foot.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   The companies’ counter-argument is always the race with China — if American companies don’t do this, Beijing will. Does that argument hold?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Let’s analyze that. The most common talking point from the lobbyists for the AI companies — they’re now better funded and more numerous than the lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry, the pharma industry and the military-industrial complex combined — is that whenever anyone proposes any kind of regulation, they say, ‘But China.’ So let’s look at that. China is in the process of banning AI girlfriends outright. Not just age limits — they’re looking at banning
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/29/china-ai-chatbot-rules-emotional-influence-suicide-gambling-zai-minimax-talkie-xingye-zhipu.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   all anthropomorphic AI
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . Why? Not because they want to please America but because they feel this is screwing up Chinese youth and making China weak. Obviously, it’s making American youth weak, too.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  And when people say we have to race to build superintelligence so we can win against China — when we don’t actually know how to control superintelligence, so that the default outcome is that humanity loses control of Earth to alien machines — guess what? The Chinese Communist Party really likes control. Who in their right mind thinks that Xi Jinping is going to tolerate some Chinese AI company building something that overthrows the Chinese government? No way. It’s clearly really bad for the American government too if it gets overthrown in a coup by the first American company to build superintelligence. This is a national security threat.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   That’s compelling framing — superintelligence as a national security threat, not an asset. Do you see that view gaining traction in Washington?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  I think if people in the national security community listen to Dario Amodei describe his vision — he’s given a famous speech where he says we’ll soon have a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/bloombergtv/reel/DU7pjUciTlB/?hl=gu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   country of geniuses in a data center
  &lt;/a&gt;
  — they might start thinking: wait, did Dario just use the word ‘country’? Maybe I should put that country of geniuses in a data center on the same threat list I’m keeping tabs on, because that sounds threatening to the U.S. government. And I think fairly soon, enough people in the U.S. national security community are going to realize that uncontrollable superintelligence is a threat, not a tool. This is totally analogous to the Cold War. There was a race for dominance — economic and military — against the Soviet Union. We Americans won that one without ever engaging in the second race, which was to see who could put the most nuclear craters in the other superpower. People realized that was just suicide. No one wins. The same logic applies here.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   What does all of this mean for the pace of AI development more broadly? How close do you think we are to the systems you’re describing?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Six years ago, almost every expert in AI I knew predicted we were decades away from having AI that could master language and knowledge at human level — maybe 2040, maybe 2050. They were all wrong, because we already have that now. We’ve seen AI progress quite rapidly from high school level to college level to PhD level to university professor level in some areas. Last year, AI won the gold medal at the International Mathematics Olympiad, which is about as difficult as human tasks get. I
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18212&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   wrote a paper
  &lt;/a&gt;
  together with
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Yoshua Bengio
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hendrycks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Dan Hendrycks
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , and other top AI researchers just a few months ago giving a rigorous definition of AGI. According to this, GPT-4 was 27% of the way there. GPT-5 was 57% of the way there. So we’re not there yet, but going from 27% to 57% that quickly suggests it might not be that long.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  When I lectured to my students yesterday at MIT, I told them that even if it takes four years, that means when they graduate, they might not be able to get any jobs anymore. It’s certainly not too soon to start preparing for it.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Anthropic is now blacklisted. I’m curious to see what happens next — will the other AI giants stand with them and say, we won’t do this either? Or does someone like xAI raise their hand and say, Anthropic didn’t want that contract, we’ll take it?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   [Editor’s note: Hours after the interview, OpenAI announced its
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/openais-sam-altman-announces-pentagon-deal-with-technical-safeguards/&quot;&gt;
    own deal
   &lt;/a&gt;
   with the Pentagon.]
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Last night, Sam Altman came out and said he stands with Anthropic and has the same red lines. I admire him for the courage of saying that. Google, as of when we started this interview, had said nothing. If they just stay quiet, I think that’s incredibly embarrassing for them as a company, and a lot of their staff will feel the same. We haven’t heard anything from xAI yet either. So it’ll be interesting to see. Basically, there’s this moment where everybody has to show their true colors.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
   Is there a version of this where the outcome is actually good?
  &lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Yes, and this is why I’m actually optimistic in a strange way. There’s such an obvious alternative here. If we just start treating AI companies like any other companies — drop the corporate amnesty — they would clearly have to do something like a clinical trial before they released something this powerful, and demonstrate to independent experts that they know how to control it. Then we get a golden age with all the good stuff from AI, without the existential angst. That’s not the path we’re on right now. But it could be.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  Netflix stunned the entertainment world this week when it
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-wbd-bid-studios-hbo-cnn-ellison/&quot;&gt;
   declined to raise its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , setting the stage for Paramount Skydance to win ownership of the Hollywood studio.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At the time, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were being financially disciplined. Now
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/how-david-ellison-outlasted-netflix-in-the-warner-bros-bidding-war&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   reporting in Bloomberg
  &lt;/a&gt;
  offers more details about why Netflix executives backed down from
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/warner-bros-netflix-paramount-acquisition-timeline-wbd/&quot;&gt;
   a bidding war that it seemed to win back in December
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For one thing, the streaming giant’s shareholders appeared deeply skeptical that the acquisition was a good deal — Netflix’s share price declined 30% since announcing the deal, while the subsequent news that it was backing down
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/business/media/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-analysts.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   sent Netflix stock up nearly 14%
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For another, Netflix’s commitment to the deal reportedly wavered after Paramount came in with an increased offer and seemed willing to go several more rounds in a bidding war.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  By the time Sarandos met with Trump administration officials on Thursday, he may already have decided to concede. In fact, since President Donald Trump had previously warned him not to overpay, Sarandos reportedly told him, “I took your advice.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Meanwhile, employees at Warner Bros. now worry about
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/28/business/warner-bros-paramount-reaction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   major studio layoffs
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/17722120321108aa883dc7fda/raw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   conservative political pressure on CNN
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The streaming and entertainment industry just witnessed one of its most high-stakes megadeals ever, stunning industry observers. Not only is it historic in its size, but it is also predicted to disrupt Hollywood and the media business as we know it.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After years of Warner Bros. Discovery struggling under the weight of billions of dollars in debt, compounded by
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/tv-burdened-wbd-will-struggle-cut-cord-2025-06-05/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   declining cable viewership
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and fierce competition from streaming platforms, the company has been considering major strategic changes, including selling its entertainment assets to one of its rivals.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Several major players saw the potential in acquiring the media giant and in December, Netflix
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros-in-a-disruptive-deal-valued-at-82-7b/&quot;&gt;
   announced it would acquire
  &lt;/a&gt;
  WBD’s studios and streaming for $82.7 billion.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But in a surprise eleventh-hour move this month, it now looks like the David Ellison-run
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-paramount-wbd-bid-studios-hbo-cnn-ellison/&quot;&gt;
   Paramount will actually be the winner
  &lt;/a&gt;
  of this bidding war, offering $111 billion to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets, including its studios, HBO, streaming platforms, games, and TV networks such as CNN and HGTV. Paramount was itself recently acquired by Ellison with significant support from his father, the Oracle chairman, world’s sixth-richest person, and major Trump donor Larry Ellison.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Paramount’s offer still awaits formal approval from WBD’s board of directors, and any potential agreement may also face pressure from regulators.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Let’s break down exactly what is happening, what’s at stake, and what could come next.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  What has happened so far?
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  ​This all started back in October when Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   revealed it was exploring a potential sale
  &lt;/a&gt;
  after receiving unsolicited interest from several major players in the industry.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  ​The bidding process quickly became competitive, and Paramount and Comcast emerged as serious contenders, with
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/david-ellisons-paramount-seen-front-runner-warner-bros-discovery-deal-2025-10-23/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Paramount
  &lt;/a&gt;
  initially viewed as the frontrunner.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, WBD’s board eventually determined that an offer from the streaming giant Netflix was the most attractive. Netflix offered $82.7 billion for just Warner’s film, television, and streaming assets.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Thus began the bidding war. Paramount believed its bid, of approximately $108 billion for all of Warner’s assets, was superior to Netflix’s offer that focused on just the studios and streaming. To sweeten its deal, Netflix
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/netflix-revises-offer-to-pay-all-cash-for-warner-bros-to-stave-off-paramount/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   amended its agreement
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in January to an all-cash offer at $27.75 per share of Warner Bros. Discovery, further reassuring investors and paving the way for the deal to proceed.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  ​Paramount
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   persisted in its attempts to acquire WBD
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . Still, the Warner board repeatedly
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-bid-again-calls-it-a-leveraged-buyout/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   rejected
  &lt;/a&gt;
  its offers, citing concerns about Paramount’s heavy debt load and the increased risk associated with its proposal, including concern over the suite of investors bankrolling Paramount’s bid, which includes Saudi, Qatari, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds. The board noted that Paramount’s offer would have left the combined company burdened with $87 billion in debt, a risk they were unwilling to take at the time.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In January, Paramount
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/paramount-files-lawsuit-against-warner-bros-amidst-controversial-netflix-merger/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   filed a lawsuit
  &lt;/a&gt;
  seeking more information about the Netflix deal. A month later, the company sought to sweeten its deal by
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-enhances-its-superior-30-per-share-all-cash-offer-for-warner-bros-discovery-and-provides-update-on-regulatory-progress-302683694.html?tc=eml_cleartime&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   announcing
  &lt;/a&gt;
  it would offer a $0.25 per share “ticking fee” to WBD shareholders for each quarter the deal fails to close by December 31, 2026. It also said it would pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee if Warner backs out of its deal with Netflix.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Then, in a final attempt to secure a deal, Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share in February. This prompted the WBD board to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-board-directors-determines-revised-proposal-paramount-skydance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   prolong discussions
  &lt;/a&gt;
  with Paramount regarding a potential agreement, considering it as a superior offer. Netflix declined to increase its bid and withdrew from the negotiations.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   said in a statement
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on Feb. 26. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In addition to the billions Paramount already holds in debt, the company is also set to assume the approximately $33 billion in debt Warner Bros. Discovery holds
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-form-next-generation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   under the agreement
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . The deal will be
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-27/paramount-s-57-5-billion-of-warner-debt-to-mix-junk-high-grade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   backed
  &lt;/a&gt;
  by a $54 billion debt commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, and Apollo Global Management, as well as $45.7 billion in equity from Larry Ellison.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In addition to the assumption of substantial debt posing a significant financial burden, Paramount faces several other hurdles in its deal with WBD that could impact the success of the transaction.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For one, Ellison has warned about significant job reductions that are expected in the near future. There have already been
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   widespread concerns among critics
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/netflix-responds-to-concerns-about-wbd-deal/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   about potential job losses
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and lower wages.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Ellison is also a controversial figure in the industry, and his ownership of CBS News has been seen as sympathetic and supportive of the administration of Donald Trump, of whom his father, Larry Ellison, is a major donor. Under Ellison’s ownership of Paramount, reporting critical of the administration has been shelved or received increased scrutiny from Ellison or his appointed head of CBS News, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This has led to some concern among employees at Warner-owned CNN. Trump has personally sought concessions from news divisions critical of him, including a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-harris-minutes-paramount-6415042fe910ae60b432dd8c73ef61b2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   $16 million settlement from CBS
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , before his FCC
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/business/media/fcc-skydance-merger-paramount.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   would approve
  &lt;/a&gt;
  the Ellison takeover of Paramount. Before Netflix bowed out of the deal, Trump
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/trump-says-netflix-will-face-consequences-if-it-doesnt-fire-board-member-susan-rice/&quot;&gt;
   pressured the company
  &lt;/a&gt;
  to fire the former Biden White House official Susan Rice from its board. He has publicly stated his intentions to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/28/trump-paramount-skydance-warner-bros-cnn-netflix&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   bring CNN to heel
  &lt;/a&gt;
  under new owners.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Regulatory scrutiny is another hurdle. Such a large-scale merger has attracted attention from lawmakers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For instance, California Attorney General Rob Bonta
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/rob-bonta-california-ag-warn-paramount-warner-bros-1236674377/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   said in a statement
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on February 26 that “these two Hollywood titans have not cleared regulatory scrutiny — the California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  A day before Netflix backed out, it was revealed that a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://dojmt.gov/attorney-general-knudsen-asks-usdoj-to-review-proposed-netflix-warner-brothers-merger/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   coalition of 11 state attorneys general
  &lt;/a&gt;
  urged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to review the merger under concerns it will stifle competition and increase subscription prices. This comes months after U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal voiced
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sen-elizabeth-warren-letter-doj-wbd-sale-paramount-1236430180/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   their concerns to the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , warning that such a massive merger could have serious consequences for consumers and the industry at large. The senators argue that the merger could give the new media giant excessive market power, enabling it to raise prices for consumers and stifle competition.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  That said, Ellison’s father, the Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, is a significant Trump donor and has close ties to the Trump administration. His deal to acquire Paramount last year cleared quickly after acquiescing to c
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  When is the deal expected to close?
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The deal is not yet final.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Initially, a deal with Netflix was expected to lead to a stockholder vote around April, with the deal anticipated to close within 12 to 18 months following that vote. However, the transition to the Paramount deal will likely create a new timeline for approval. Plus, regulatory approvals are still pending, and scrutiny could shape the final outcome.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Stay tuned…
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  Anthropic’s chatbot Claude seems to have benefited from the attention around the company’s fraught negotiations with the Pentagon.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/28/anthropics-claude-apple-apps.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   first reported by CNBC
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , as of Saturday afternoon, Claude is currently ranked number two among free apps in Apple’s US App Store — the number one app is OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and number three is Google Gemini.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  According to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6473753684?country=US&amp;tab=category_rankings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   data from SensorTower
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Claude was just outside the top 100 at the end of January, and has spent most of February somewhere in the top 20. Its ranking has climbed in the last few days, from sixth on Wednesday to fourth on Thursday to second on Saturday (today).
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After Anthropic attempted to negotiate for safeguards preventing the Department of Defense from using its AI models for mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to stop using all Anthropic products and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he’s
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/&quot;&gt;
   designating the company a supply-chain threat
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  OpenAI subsequently
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/openais-sam-altman-announces-pentagon-deal-with-technical-safeguards/&quot;&gt;
   announced its own agreement with the Pentagon
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , which CEO Sam Altman claimed includes safeguards related to domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there’s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-boom-far-over-after-tepid-sales-forecast-2025-08-28/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   recent earnings call
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Microsoft’s 2019 investment in OpenAI
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom:
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   In 2019
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   in the form of Azure cloud credit
  &lt;/a&gt;
  rather than cash.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. Last year, OpenAI announced it would
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-is-no-longer-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider/&quot;&gt;
   no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. Microsoft has also begun exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-amazon-trainium&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   making kernel-level modifications
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/how-ai-startups-are-fueling-googles-booming-cloud-business/&quot;&gt;
   smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf
  &lt;/a&gt;
  as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-171740706.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   in September
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  The rise of Oracle
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company’s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   a spot alongside Google
  &lt;/a&gt;
  as one of OpenAI’s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company’s stock went shooting up.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  A few months later, it happened again.
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal/&quot;&gt;
   On September 10
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle’s stock
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/why-the-oracle-openai-deal-caught-wall-street-by-surprise/&quot;&gt;
   climbed even higher
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers — and a financial force to be reckoned with.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;
  Nvidia’s investment spree
 &lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they’re mostly buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash — and it’s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, Nvidia bought
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/nvidia-buys-5-billion-stake-in-intel-planning-ai-chip-collaboration/&quot;&gt;
   a 4% stake in rival Intel
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for $5 billion — but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-on-100-billion-openai-investment-as-huang-touts-biggest-ai-infrastructure-project-in-history-171740509.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   a $100 billion investment in OpenAI
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI’s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk’s xAI, and OpenAI launched
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement
  &lt;/a&gt;
  with AMD.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If that seems circular, it’s because it is. Nvidia’s GPUs are valuable because they’re so scarce — and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI’s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can’t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried — but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Building tomorrow’s hyperscale data centers
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For companies like Meta that already have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacm.acm.org/research/metas-hyperscale-infrastructure-overview-and-insights/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   significant legacy infrastructure
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , the story is more complicated — although equally expensive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/meta-plans-spend-600-billion-2028-u-s-zuckerberg-says&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   through the end of 2028
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the first half of 2025, the company spent
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/meta-to-spend-up-to-72b-on-ai-infrastructure-in-2025-as-compute-arms-race-escalates/&quot;&gt;
   $30 billion more
  &lt;/a&gt;
  than the previous year, driven largely by the company’s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://aimagazine.com/news/inside-metas-cloud-deal-with-google-for-ai-infrastructure&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   $10 billion deal with Google Cloud
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/55248311/meta-sees-10b-ai-data-center-in-louisiana-using-combo-of-clean-energy-nuclear-power&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   dubbed Hyperion
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-a-5gw-ai-data-center/&quot;&gt;
   provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk’s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/06/elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR5SDS-dmGr0PSpTHkF5PV2cXs3-rKqNuPaMbeyJmaGGE56-qWvJrA29i9S4pg_aem_leaKorFEsIQuzImIDd960A&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   experts say violate the Clean Air Act
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  The Stargate moonshot
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Just two days after his second inauguration last January, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history.” OpenAI’s Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman’s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum.
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/softbank-concedes-stargate-project-with-openai-needs-more-time&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   In August
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/stargate-abilene/abilenes-data-center-advances-swiftly-with-5000-workers/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   eight data centers in Abilene, Texas
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  The capex crunch
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Capital expenditures” are usually a pretty dry metric, referring to a company’s spending on physical assets. But as tech companies lined up to report their capex plans for 2026, the rush of data center spending
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/&quot;&gt;
   made the figures a lot more interesting
  &lt;/a&gt;
  — and a lot bigger.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Amazon was the capex leader, projecting $200 billion in 2026 spending (up from $131 billion in 2025), while Google was a close second with an estimate between $175 billion and $185 billion (up from $91 billion in 2025). Meta estimated $115 billion to $135 billion (up from $71 billion the previous year), although that figure is a little deceptive because a lot of the data center projects have been
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/jobs-report-unemployment-stock-market-02-11-2026/card/meta-auditor-ey-raised-red-flag-on-data-center-accounting-TrOVlxGZGnL37d8Dv01h?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfLXi35LrT-GxBcA2HfmYDh8FG583K_0E6c2WgM_SIDUcsKWHr4kNRX1d6jgvY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69a20a98&amp;gaa_sig=5xmE3fdoZvA2Mg1RclWhfPyZ8-sO-CcIMq4H5IxjABAspxoyn9VKlAjU2ngMwO5DQdwlGnGuVoCBE0SIXkX1pg%3D%3D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   kept off their books entirely
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . All told, hyperscalers are planning to spend
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   nearly $700 billion on data center projects in 2026 alone
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  It was enough money to spook some investors. The companies were mostly undeterred, however, explaining that AI infrastructure was vital to their companies’ future. It’s set up a strange dynamic. As you might expect, tech executives are more bullish on AI than their Wall Street counterparts — and the more tech companies spend, the more nervous their bankers get. Add in the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/31/ai-data-centers-debt-sam-altman-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   huge amounts of debt
  &lt;/a&gt;
  many companies are taking on to fund those buildouts, and you start to hear CFOs across the valley grinding their teeth.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  That hasn’t put a damper on AI spending yet, but it will soon — unless of course, hyperscalers show they can make those investments pay off.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced late on Friday that his company has reached an agreement allowing the Department of Defense to use its AI models in the department’s classified network.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This follows a high-profile standoff between the department — also known under the Trump administration as the Department of War — and OpenAI’s rival Anthropic. The Pentagon
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/anthropic-and-the-pentagon-are-reportedly-arguing-over-claude-usage/&quot;&gt;
   pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models be used “all lawful purposes,”
  &lt;/a&gt;
  while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   a lengthy statement released Thursday
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an
  &lt;em&gt;
   ad hoc
  &lt;/em&gt;
  manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  More than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/employees-at-google-and-openai-support-anthropics-pentagon-stand-in-open-letter/&quot;&gt;
   signed an open letter this week
  &lt;/a&gt;
  asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  After Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/pentagon-moves-to-designate-anthropic-as-a-supply-chain-risk/&quot;&gt;
   a social media post
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase out period.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/sama/status/2027578580159631610&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   a separate post
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On Friday,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Anthropic said
  &lt;/a&gt;
  it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Surprisingly, Altman
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/sama/status/2027578580159631610&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   claimed in a post on X
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that OpenAI’s new defense contract includes protections addressing the same issues that became a flashpoint for Anthropic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems,” Altman said. “The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Altman said OpenAI “will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted,” and it will deploy engineers with the Pentagon “to help with our models and to ensure their safety.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies, which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept,” Altman added. “We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/sharongoldman/status/2027515992021340599&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Fortune’s Sharon Goldman reports
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that Altman told OpenAI employees at an all-hands meeting that the government will allow the company to build its own “safety stack” to prevent misuse, and that “if the model refuses to do a task, then the government would not force OpenAI to make it do that task.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Altman’s post came shortly before news broke that the U.S. and Israeli governments
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/28/world/iran-strikes-trump&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   have begun bombing Iran
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , with Trump calling for the overthrow of the Iranian government.
 &lt;/p&gt;

   unveil its first humanoid robot
  &lt;/a&gt;
  at MWC in Spain.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Robotics was flagged as a priority under the country’s

   “Made in China 2025” plan
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , albeit originally focused on factory automation, rather than humanoids. Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Global humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2026/01/09/top-10-humanoid-robot-companies-by-shipments-revealed/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   according to a Forbes
  &lt;/a&gt;
  report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution. The report notes it remains unclear how many units represent commercial sales versus demo models or pilot deployments, underscoring the early-stage nature of the industry.)
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The top humanoid robot makers by 2025 shipments were led by China’s Agibot and Unitree, followed by UBTech, Leju Robotics, Engine AI, and Fourier Intelligence, underscoring Beijing’s early dominance in the sector.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The biggest shift recently has been from “demo-driven excitement” to “operations-driven adoption,” Yuli Zhao, chief strategy officer at Galbot, told TechCrunch. Galbot’s humanoid robot, the G1, appeared at this year’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s annual, state-run lunar New Year’s Eve television show, alongside robots from
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.news.cn/20260219/f2e7e299286e4956862a500317b20acd/c.html#:~:text=Four%20prominent%20rising%20humanoid%20robot,appeared%20in%20regional%20arts%20events.&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Unitree Robotics, Noetix, and MagicLab.
  &lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “More customers are asking: Can the robot run stably in real environments and actually take work off people’s plates? That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-robotics-firm-unitree-eyeing-7-billion-ipo-valuation-sources-say-2025-09-08/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   $7 billion in a future IPO
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . Meanwhile,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/galbot-secures-over-300-million-190800748.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Galbot
  &lt;/a&gt;
  has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  U.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals.
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2025/12/16/humanoid-robots-for-war-and-work-startup-plans-to-build-50000-by-end-of-2027/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   U.S. startup Foundation
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  But China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251209-12825.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   TrendForce report
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Bottlenecks to China’s dominance
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  When it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Yet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Safety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Given the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  Other APAC players
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Humanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan-forward.com/japan-to-mass-produce-humanoid-robots-by-2027/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   targeting humanoid mass production by 2027
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Coral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Hyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit

   30,000 units annually in the U.S.
  &lt;/a&gt;
  as part of its AI-driven robotics push.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&amp;D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Xiaomi today launched a slew of gadgets ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona including a camera-focused flagship smartphone, an AirTag clone, Xiaomi Watch 5 smartwatch, and an ultra slim power bank.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The China-based company has partnered with camera maker Leica to co-brand its Xiaomi 17 Ultra smartphone. As part of the partnership, it is using Leica lenses and creating filters in the style of the German camera company.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The phone has a 50-megapixel main sensor with an F/1.67 aperture and a 1-inch sensor. But the main attraction is the 200-megapixel telephoto camera that has a variable focal length of 75mm-100mm equivalent. That means you can zoom optically between 3.2x and 4.3x. The phone also has a 50 MP ultrawide camera with an f/2.2 aperture.
 &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Also notable: The phone packs a 6,000 mAh battery (the Chinese version comes with a bigger 6,800mAh battery). The phone could be charged using a 90W USB PD-PPS, and it supports Xiaomi’s Hypercharge wireless tech at 50W.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The device has a 6.9-inch Xiaomi HyperRGB OLED display protected by Xiaomi’s own Shield Glass 3.0. The company has picked Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, which was also used in the recently launched Galaxy S26 series.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company is also releasing a special Leica edition phone to celebrate 100 years of the camera company. The device has a durable aluminum-alloy body with a nickel-anodized finish. Xiaomi has also added a Leica theme on the software side.
 &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The device has a rotating ring that mimics zoom on a physical camera. The special edition also has a “Leica Essential mode,” which has filters that recreate photos in the style of Leica M9 and Leica M3.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Xiaomi launched the Xiaomi 17 with a larger 6,330 mAh battery, which can be charged at 100W using  the company’s HyperCharge tech.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company is also launching two photography add-ons for the Xiaomi 17 Ultra. The 17 Ultra Photography Kit is a Bluetooth-connected snap-on that has a two-stage shutter button and a video recording button.The Xiaomi 17 Ultra Photography Kit Pro aims to mimic a physical camera with a leather finish, a video recording button, a detachable shutter button, and zoom control. This kit snaps on using a USB-C connection and also has a 2,000 mAh battery for its operation. Using this add-on, users can also use a new fastshot mode on the phone.

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company also launched a new Xiaomi tag, an AirTag-like device, which works with both Apple Find My and Google Android Find Hub. The tag weighs just 10 grams and has a button cell battery that lasts over a year. You can also play a sound remotely to find the tag or the time at which the tag is attached. The company is pricing this tag at €14.9 for one and €49.99 for a pack of four.

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/supabase/status/2026374754438087119&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   acknowledging the issue
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  An Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  While Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, Supabase’s
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://supabase.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   main website
  &lt;/a&gt;
  remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  India is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem. The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  India has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/indian-government-censorsht/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   access to developer platform GitHub
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/github-content-domain-blocked-for-these-indian-users-reports/articleshow/96687992.cms&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   reported
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/vibe-coding-helps-supabase-nab-200m-at-2b-valuation-just-seven-months-after-its-last-raise/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   gained traction
  &lt;/a&gt;
  amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/03/supabase-nabs-5b-valuation-four-months-after-hitting-2b/&quot;&gt;
   valuation to $5 billion
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  In a post on Truth Social, President Trump directed federal agencies to cease use of all Anthropic products after the company’s
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-vs-the-pentagon-whats-actually-at-stake/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   public dispute with the Department of Defense
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably, the president’s post does not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/secwar/status/2027507717469049070?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   a subsequent tweet
  &lt;/a&gt;
  from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  CEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   in a public post on Thursday
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , refusing to compromise on the two points.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,” Amodei wrote at the time. “Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  OpenAI has fired an employee over the employee’s activity on prediction markets, including Polymarket, the company
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/openai-fires-employee-insider-trading-polymarket-kalshi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   confirmed to Wired.
  &lt;/a&gt;
  The employee used confidential OpenAI information in connection with the trades made, the company alleges.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  OpenAI didn’t release the name of the employee. However, a spokesperson said that such actions violated a company policy that bans workers from using inside information for personal gain, including on prediction markets.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi allow people to make wagers on the outcomes of real-world events. For instance, on Polymarket, there are wagers being made around the kind of products OpenAI will announce in 2026 and when the company will go public. They can cover any event, and some eye-popping money can be made. As we recently reported,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/an-accountant-won-a-big-jackpot-on-kalshi-by-betting-against-doge/&quot;&gt;
   an accountant won a $470,300 jackpot on Kalshi
  &lt;/a&gt;
  by betting against DOGE believers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Prediction markets insist they are not gambling sites, preferring to label themselves as financial platforms. Kalshi is a regulated exchange and, in fact, it

   fined and banned a MrBeast editor for similar alleged insider trading
  &lt;/a&gt;
  earlier this week. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The past two weeks have been defined by a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   clash
  &lt;/a&gt;
  between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Anthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  On Thursday,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Amodei publicly signaled
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  At its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  What is Anthropic worried about?
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  As we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esd.whs.mil/portals/54/documents/dd/issuances/dodd/300009p.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   2023 DOD directive
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  That’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Anthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  AI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  What does the Pentagon want?
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  More specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Thursday X post
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  He added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Despite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4377190/remarks-by-secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-at-spacex/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;
  So what now?
 &lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  xAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2027294561467613256&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Elon Musk’s rhetoric
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   reports
  &lt;/a&gt;
  indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety.  He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The comment came up in a line of questioning about a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/1100-notable-signatories-just-signed-an-open-letter-asking-all-ai-labs-to-immediately-pause-for-at-least-6-months/&quot;&gt;
   public letter
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Those fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialmediavictims.org/press-releases/smvlc-tech-justice-law-project-lawsuits-accuse-chatgpt-of-emotional-manipulation-supercharging-ai-delusions-and-acting-as-a-suicide-coach/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   series of lawsuits
  &lt;/a&gt;
  alleging that
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/&quot;&gt;
   ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics
  &lt;/a&gt;
  have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/elon-musk-openai-sam-altman-court/&quot;&gt;
   lawsuit
  &lt;/a&gt;
  against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/&quot;&gt;
   Musk claims violated
  &lt;/a&gt;
  its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own, however. Last month, Musk’s social network X was
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/&quot;&gt;
   flooded with non-consensual nude images
  &lt;/a&gt;
  generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/&quot;&gt;
   were said to be of minors
  &lt;/a&gt;
  . This led the California Attorney General’s office to
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-launches-investigation-xai-grok-over-undressed-sexual-ai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   open an investigation
  &lt;/a&gt;
  into the matter. The EU is also
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/musks-grok-chatbot-faces-eu-privacy-investigation-over-sexualized-deepfake-images&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   running its own investigation
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted to — AI safety to be prioritized.” …
 &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Musk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI —  the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/&quot;&gt;

  to OpenAI; the

   second amended complaint
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  He also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

  A new set of main series Pokémon games is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2027, marking the 10th installment in the series.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In a livestream celebrating the release of the first Pokémon games exactly 30 years ago, the company unveiled Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves, open-world games set across a vast ocean of islands.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;

  The three new starter Pokémon were announced as well: Browt, a Grass type “bean chick” that looks like an Angry Bird; Pombon, a Pomeranian-inspired Fire type who

   better not evolve into a bipedal man
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ; and Gecqua, a Water type gecko with big pink eyes.

  Leakers have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-gen-10-name-region-and-battle-mechanics-reportedly-leaked/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   rumored
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that the new games are set in a region inspired by Indonesia and Southeast Asia — while the trailer doesn’t explicitly confirm this, it makes a good case for proving the rumors correct, showing us lush jungles, seaside mountains, tropical towns, and even underwater reefs. Fans have also honed in on a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-winds-waves-cloud-legendary-gyarados-theories-trailer/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   suspicious-looking cloud
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Pokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly 10 years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!
 &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Main series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region … but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/21/pokemon-scarlet-violet-preview/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
  &lt;/a&gt;
  came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and being rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen games today for the Switch … but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/retro-game-emulator-delta-app-store-ios/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   extremely easy and legally dubious
  &lt;/a&gt;
  way to get those games on your phone for free.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

  ChatGPT has reached 900 million weekly active users, OpenAI
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/index/scaling-ai-for-everyone/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   announced
  &lt;/a&gt;
  Friday, putting the AI chatbot within striking distance of 1 billion. OpenAI also shared that it now has 50 million paying subscribers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Subscriber momentum accelerated meaningfully to start the year, with January and February on track to be the largest months for new subscribers in our history,” the company wrote in a blog post. “People use ChatGPT to learn, write, plan, and build. As usage scales, the product improves in ways people feel immediately: faster responses, higher reliability, stronger safety, and more consistent performance.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The figure marks a jump of 100 million users from the
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/&quot;&gt;
   800 million
  &lt;/a&gt;
  OpenAI reported in October 2025.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  OpenAI shared the new numbers as part of its announcement that it has
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/27/openai-raises-110b-in-one-of-the-largest-private-funding-rounds-in-history/&quot;&gt;
   raised $110 billion
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in private funding, marking one of the largest private funding rounds in history. The new funding includes a $50 billion investment from Amazon, along with $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, at a $730 billion pre-money valuation. The round remains open, and the company expects more investors to join.
  &lt;br/&gt;

   Formula 1
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Apple and Netflix have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/formula-1-apple-netflix-drive-to-survive&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   entered a partnership
  &lt;/a&gt;
  to co-broadcast the Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix, announced Thursday by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. For the first time, F1 fans in the U.S. will be able to watch the live race simultaneously on both Apple TV and Netflix.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Netflix subscribers will be able to stream the full race weekend — including practice, qualifying, and the Grand Prix itself on May 24 — live on the platform.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  ​Beyond live race coverage, the partnership includes cross-promotion of Netflix’s hit series, “Drive to Survive.” For the first time, the eighth season — which consists of eight episodes covering the 2025 Formula One World Championship — will be available to both Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. and Netflix users globally, significantly broadening its audience.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Season 8 premieres today, on February 27.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  F1’s rise in American culture extends beyond television at this point — Brad Pitt’s F1 film is nominated for Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards. “Drive to Survive” has successfully
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4402239/2023/04/13/f1-formula-one-drive-to-survive-ratings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   attracted a diverse audience
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for its behind-the-scenes approach, transforming it from a typical sports docuseries into a compelling narrative that’s brought in millions of new fans.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The series has been a particular focus of Apple’s broader F1 ambitions: the company has said it plans to promote the sport across Apple News, Apple Maps (highlighting F1 tracks around the world), Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+, as well as in its physical retail stores.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This collaboration also means Netflix continues to push into live sports broadcasting, after pivoting from a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/25/netflix-is-not-yet-considering-live-sports-but-heres-why-it-should/&quot;&gt;
   “no-sports” stance
  &lt;/a&gt;
  to securing major rights for
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/netflix-adds-more-live-tv-to-its-lineup/&quot;&gt;
   NFL Christmas games
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wwe-raw-netflix-release-date-news&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   WWE Raw
  &lt;/a&gt;
  , and
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/mlb-netflix-opening-day-home-run-derby-field-of-dreams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   MLB
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Additionally, the joint effort comes as part of Apple’s new
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/17/apple-and-formula-1-ink-five-year-us-streaming-deal-bringing-all-races-to-apple-tv/&quot;&gt;
   multi-year deal
  &lt;/a&gt;
  with Formula 1, under which Apple TV replaced ESPN as the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for all 24 races beginning this season. The deal is reportedly valued at around $150 million per season, a significant jump from the roughly
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.planetf1.com/news/f1-2025-revenue-record-3-billion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   $85 million
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ESPN reportedly paid. All races are available to Apple TV subscribers at no extra charge. The previous partnership with ESPN achieved an average viewership of
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/12/espn-finishes-final-formula-1-season-with-all-time-viewership-record/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   1.3 million
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in its final year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Notably,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/07/netflix-espn-and-nbcuniversal-compete-for-u-s-formula-1-rights-report-says/&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  was previously reported to be eyeing U.S. media rights for Formula 1 back in 2022.

   shared on LinkedIn
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that the AI music generator has amassed 2 million paid subscribers and $300 million in annual recurring revenue.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Just three months ago, Suno announced a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/legally-embattled-ai-music-startup-suno-raises-at-2-45b-valuation-on-200m-revenue/&quot;&gt;
   $250 million funding round
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that valued the company at $2.45 billion. At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Suno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/&quot;&gt;
   settled its lawsuit
  &lt;/a&gt;
  and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Suno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   How Was I Supposed to Know
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
   $3 million
  &lt;/a&gt;
  .
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, many musicians have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/02/nicki-minaj-billie-eilish-katy-perry-and-other-musicians-sign-letter-against-irresponsible-ai/&quot;&gt;
   spoken out
  &lt;/a&gt;
  against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more.
 &lt;/p&gt;

  A new set of main series Pokémon games is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2027, marking the 10th installment in the series.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In a livestream celebrating the release of the first Pokémon games exactly thirty years ago, the company unveiled “Pokémon Winds and Waves,” an open-world game set across a vast ocean of islands.

  The three new starter Pokémon were announced as well: Browt, a grass-type “bean chick” that looks like an Angry Bird; Pombon, a Pomeranian-inspired fire-type who

 &lt;p&gt;
  Leakers have
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-gen-10-name-region-and-battle-mechanics-reportedly-leaked/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   rumored
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that the new game is set in a region inspired by Indonesia and Southeast Asia — while the trailer doesn’t explicitly confirm this, it makes a good case for proving the rumors correct, showing us lush jungles, seaside mountains, tropical towns, and even underwater reefs. Fans have also honed in on a
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-winds-waves-cloud-legendary-gyarados-theories-trailer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   suspicious-looking cloud
  &lt;/a&gt;
  in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Pokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly ten years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;iframe data-bluesky-id=&quot;7900018723116266&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://embed.bsky.app/embed/did:plc:bfqjii4th4ezgadtaua6je6y/app.bsky.feed.post/3mftx5zaug22f?id=7900018723116266&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Ftechcrunch.com%252F2026%252F02%252F27%252Fpokemon-winds-and-waves-are-coming-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-2027%252F&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Main series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region… but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since “
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/21/pokemon-scarlet-violet-preview/&quot;&gt;
   Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
  &lt;/a&gt;
  ” came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  In the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the “Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen” games today for the Switch… but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/retro-game-emulator-delta-app-store-ios/&quot;&gt;
   extremely easy and legally dubious
  &lt;/a&gt;
  way to get those games on your phone for free.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Starting this week, Perplexity subscribers will have a new agentic tool at their disposal.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Perplexity Computer, in the company’s words, “unifies every current AI capability into a single system.” More specifically, Perplexity says it is a computer user agent can execute complex workflows independently using 19 different AI models, even creating subagents to handle specific problems.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The tool is available now, only on the company’s highest subscription tier, the $200/month Perplexity Max. It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  TechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/Hkq2C4Wr9rhr0OV9hOfNI4oA4y?domain=perplexity.ai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   example workflows
  &lt;/a&gt;
  on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Perplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  This tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Now, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Perplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Perplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;

    Perplexity
   &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  If one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Still, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  And there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  One executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;
  Anthropic has reached a stalemate with the United States Department of War over the military’s
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/26/anthropic-ceo-stands-firm-as-pentagon-deadline-looms/&quot;&gt;
   request for unrestricted access
  &lt;/a&gt;
  to the AI company’s technology. But as the Pentagon’s
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   Friday afternoon deadline
  &lt;/a&gt;
  for Anthropic’s compliance approaches, over 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees have signed
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://notdivided.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   an open letter
  &lt;/a&gt;
  urging the leaders of their companies to support Anthropic and refuse this unilateral use.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Specifically, Anthropic stood in opposition to the use of AI for domestic mass surveillance and autonomous weaponry. The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  The letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Leaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  However, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/27/anthropic-pentagon-ai-policy-war-spying.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   said
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Hadas_Gold/status/2027389332445671498?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
   confirmed
  &lt;/a&gt;
  that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Google DeepMind has not formally addressed the conflict, but Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, presumably speaking as an individual, did express opposition to mass surveillance by the government.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  “Mass surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment and has a chilling effect on freedom of expression,” Dean

  According to an

  report, the military currently can use X’s Grok, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT for unclassified tasks, and has been negotiating with Google and OpenAI to bring its technology over for use in classified work.

  While Anthropic has an existing partnership with the Pentagon, the AI company has remained firm in maintaining the boundary that its AI be used for neither mass domestic surveillance, nor fully autonomous weaponry.

  &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/defense-secretary-summons-anthropics-amodei-over-military-use-of-claude/&quot;&gt;
   told Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei

  that if his company doesn’t concede, the Pentagon will either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to comply with military demands.

  &lt;/a&gt;
  , Amodei maintained his company’s position. “These latter two threats are inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security,” the statement reads. “Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.”
