&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Happy Halloween, dear reader!
   &lt;i&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/i&gt;
   wishes you a wonderfully scary day. To kick things off, we’ve twisted On Call, our weekly reader-contributed column about keeping computers alive despite the best efforts of zombie coworkers and demonic bosses, to bring tales of times tech support turned spooky.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Our first story comes from a reader we’ll Regomize as “Vlad,” who told us that he once worked on the audio-visual team at a large theme park.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “Every year we had a Halloween event that involved opening temporary attractions that featured a lot of special effects run by actors,” he told On Call, before explaining that “For us in the AV world, the term ‘Performer’ or ‘Actor’ conjures the same emotions our brothers in arms in IT think about when they hear ‘End User’.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   One Halloween, Vlad got the job of supporting one of these attractions, which was made up of a series of themed rooms with connecting corridors.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Actors in each room put on a little Halloween-themed performance, and guests were expected to move from room to room in sequence to experience the full horror of the attraction.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   As guests left each room, the actors were supposed to use a small touch screen – powered by a Raspberry Pi – to reset the special effects for the next set of victims.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “One day, a few hours into operation, I received a frantic radio call from the actors saying the touchscreen in the final room wasn&#x27;t working,” Vlad told On Call. “I abandoned my cup of tea and sprinted to the room, hoping to find a dislodged power or HDMI cable for an easy fix so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to close the attraction for remedial work.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   When he arrived, he looked at the touch screen “and burst out laughing.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “We mounted this touchscreen rather conspicuously, and the issue turned out to be the piece of blackout cloth draped over it to conceal its presence did its job so well, it completely blocked the glow from the screen,” Vlad told On Call. “The actor therefore thought the screen was dead.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “In fairness to them, it was a dark room, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact this actor had already done several shows in the room,” Vlad wrote.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
   The mainframe connected to God
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A reader we’ll Regomize as “Victor” sent us another spooky story.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “I was responsible for the computers of a business school that had just started offering computer courses the previous year,” he told On Call.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Just before Halloween, some slightly embarrassed students showed him some core dumps – printed records of whatever was in the mainframe’s memory when it crashed – and wanted to know why passages from the Bible appeared among the code.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Victor interrogated the students and learned that this problem had manifested before – almost always on Mondays. The students knew their theory was silly, but couldn’t help but wonder if the holy spirit was entering the mainframe on Sundays, leading to Bible passages appearing in memory come Monday.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Victor asked some of the school’s teachers if they knew who used the machine on weekends, and one of them admitted that they were using the mainframe to make a database of Bible scriptures.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Mainframe memory of this era was non-volatile, so some of the database remained in memory by the time the students started using the machine on Monday.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “As different people ran their programs over the week, more and more of the scriptures would be overwritten until nothing remained … only to come back the next Monday,” Victor explained.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Our last story comes from a reader we’ll Regomize as “Hannibal”, who once worked for a small semiconductor company that encouraged staff to dress up for Halloween.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “On went my classic grim reaper costume with a very large fake scythe and veiled face covering,” he told On Call, and said he enjoyed watching his coworkers react when he approached and foretold their demise.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “Finally, one of them became so discombobulated that they demanded I take off the veil so they could see who I was,” he wrote.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “Little did they know I had been waiting all day for that request as I was wearing a Dick Cheney mask underneath for the full scare!”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This story took place not long after Cheney, then vice-president of the USA, accidentally shot a friend.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “I was allowed to go about my business undisturbed the rest of the day,” Hannibal told On Call.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

<title> Suspected Chinese snoops weaponize unpatched Windows flaw to spy on European diplomats </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/suspected_chinese_snoops_abuse_unpatched/</link>

&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Cyber spies linked to the Chinese government exploited a Windows shortcut vulnerability disclosed in March – but that Microsoft hasn&#x27;t fixed yet – to target European diplomats in an effort to steal defense and national security details.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Security firm Arctic Wolf attributed the espionage campaign to UNC6384 (aka Mustang Panda, Twill Typhoon), and in research published Thursday detailed how the suspected PRC spies used social engineering and the Windows flaw to deploy PlugX malware against personnel attending diplomatic conferences in September and October.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;This campaign demonstrates UNC6384&#x27;s capability for rapid vulnerability adoption within six months of public disclosure, advanced social engineering leveraging detailed knowledge of diplomatic calendars and event themes, and operational expansion from traditional Southeast Asia targeting to European diplomatic entities,&quot; the Arctic Wolf Labs threat research team
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/unc6384-weaponizes-zdi-can-25373-vulnerability-to-deploy-plugx/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    said

    UNC6384
   &lt;/a&gt;
   is a suspected Beijing-backed crew that, according to Google&#x27;s Threat Intelligence Group, targeted diplomats in Southeast Asia earlier this year before ultimately deploying the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/14/fbi_french_cops_boot_chinas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;
   of Beijing-backed goon squads that allows them to remotely access and control infected machines, steal files, and deploy additional malware.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In its latest campaign, UNC6384 targeted diplomats in Belgium, Hungary, Italy, and the Netherlands, along with Serbian government aviation departments during September and October 2025, according to Arctic Wolf.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;
   and reported this flaw to Microsoft in March, and said it had been

    abused as a zero-day
   &lt;/a&gt;
   as far back as 2017, with 11 state-sponsored groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China abusing ZDI-CAN-25373 for cyber espionage and data theft purposes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
   Blame ZDI-CAN-25373
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The attacks begin with phishing emails using very specific themed lures around European defense and security cooperation and cross-border infrastructure development. Those emails delivered a weaponized LNK file which exploited ZDI-CAN-25373 (aka
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9491&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    CVE-2025-9491
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ), a Windows shortcut vulnerability, to let the attackers secretly execute commands by adding whitespace padding within the LNK file&#x27;s COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS structure.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The malicious files, such as one named Agenda_Meeting 26 Sep Brussels.lnk, use diplomatic conference themes as lures along with a decoy PDF document, in this case displaying a real European Commission meeting agenda on facilitating the free movement of goods at border crossing points between the EU and Western Balkan countries.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The LNK file, when executed, invokes PowerShell to decode and extract a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

   (tape archive) archive containing three files to enable the attack chain via DLL side-loading, a malware delivery technique favored by several Chinese government crews, including

    Salt Typhoon
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   DLL sideloading exploits the Windows DLL search order by tricking an application into loading a malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    a valid timestamp
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , so this allows the attackers to bypass security tools and deliver malware using DLL sideloading.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The malicious DLL functions as a loader to decrypt and execute the third file in the archive, cnmplog.dat, which contains the encrypted PlugX payload.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   PlugX, which has been around since at least 2008, is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that gives attackers all the remote access capabilities including command execution, keylogging, file uploading and downloading, persistent access, and system reconnaissance.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;This three-stage execution flow completes the deployment of PlugX malware running stealthily within a legitimate signed process, significantly reducing the likelihood of detection by endpoint security solutions,&quot; the researchers wrote.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   Microsoft did not immediately respond to

<title> Robotic lawnmower uses AI to dodge cats, toys </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/01/robotic_lawnmower_ai/</link>
<pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 08:40:27 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The tentacles of AI seem to be reaching everywhere, even to the humble lawnmower. We tested the Sunseeker Elite X5, a robotic mower that uses machine learning to steer around your lawn, to see what happens when artificial intelligence meets whirling blades of doom.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The X5 weighs in at 26.5 pounds (12 kg) and measures 26.7 x 16.7 x 10.2 inches (68 x 42.5 x 26 cm). It has a 5 Ah battery, which, in our testing, lasted for just over an hour, at which point the robot will trundle back to its charging station.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The makers claim it will handle a lawn area up to 2,000 m² with a maximum slope of 60 percent or 30 degrees, although we couldn&#x27;t verify the latter. The chunky front wheels and single rear steering wheel certainly seemed up to the job and made light work of the undulations of the patch of grass we unleashed it on.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Cutting is performed using a floating cutting disk, capable of producing a 22 cm swathe through grass, with a cutting height ranging from 20 to 60 mm.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/10/31/sunseeker_blades.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;The grass cutting disc of the Sunseeker Elite X5 with three blades&quot; height=&quot;486&quot; src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/10/31/sunseeker_blades.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1&quot; title=&quot;Beware the whirling blades of doom (if you&#x27;re grass)&quot; width=&quot;648&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Beware the whirling blades of doom (if you&#x27;re grass) - Click to enlarge
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Although our inner child was hoping that the setup might resemble the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vintagetoyemporium.com/post/big-trak-one-of-the-hottest-selling-toys-in-1979&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Big Trak
   &lt;/a&gt;
   of our childhood, with buttons on top used to define a mowing pattern, the X5 had an altogether more competent approach via an app to define mowing zones and schedules. Setting up a mowing zone is a simple case of walking the mower around its boundary and saving the zone. The machine then emerges from its charger at the appointed time and mows the selected areas in neat lines.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Like the vast majority of robot lawnmowers, it also does not collect any grass. The theory is that regular use will result in minimal grass cuttings, but it&#x27;s still an annoying omission, particularly on the first run.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Tech-wise, the much-vaunted AI technology is used for obstacle avoidance and boundary tracking. The silicon inside is capable of 10 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second). By comparison, Microsoft&#x27;s AI-infused
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/28/copilot_pc_sales_grow_slowly/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Copilot+ PCs
   &lt;/a&gt;
   require a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of 40 TOPS. That said, the X5 is unlikely to ruin Windows Notepad and load up Paint with useless features.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   According to the device&#x27;s makers, &quot;Through the learning capability of the visual model, the Elite X5 can better recognize various scenarios it encounters. Algorithms enable analysis and reasoning to better identify obstacles, hazardous areas or boundaries, allowing the mower to determine its travel strategy.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In practice, it managed to avoid the family cat and dodge toys left on the lawn. Sadly, however, there is no way to stream what its cameras are viewing back to its controlling app.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While the marketing for the device might imply satellite navigation, the reality is more prosaic. A separate base station is required, which the mower uses to determine its location. The manufacturer told us, &quot;The X5 adopts physical RTK (real-time kinematic) technology. It uses real-time differential positioning between a base station and the mower to eliminate position errors, achieving higher positioning accuracy.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Future models will eliminate the need for a base station with nRTK (network real-time kinematic) technology, which transmits differential data over a network. There is, however, no upgrade path for the X5.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The base station requirement is frustrating, not least because it and the charger both require separate power supplies. It&#x27;s a shame that the base station couldn&#x27;t be integrated into the charger, but having the two separate means that the base station can be mounted on, for example, the roof of a shed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In use, the X5 is quiet, effective, and efficient. While we couldn&#x27;t help but hum the theme to
   &lt;i&gt;
    Robocop
   &lt;/i&gt;
   while it did its thing, the resulting finish and stripes were impressive, although the need to set the cutting height manually is an annoyance, as is the requirement for two power sockets. The device is well-adapted for the UK climate and will return to its charger if it detects rain. The mower is IPX5 water-resistant, allowing it to be hosed down (although not with a pressure washer), while the base station is IPX4 water-resistant, capable of withstanding rain.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   With an MRP of €1,899, the X5 is not a cheap robot, although it compares favorably to the competition. Something like the Eufy Robot Lawn Mower E15 is a little more affordable, but won&#x27;t work so well in low light and struggles with uneven surfaces. There is something deeply satisfying about a tidy lawn, neatly mown into stripes every day. For people with the lawn and budget, the X5 is a useful garden tool.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   AI assistants might be regarded with suspicion by many in the tech world, but this seems an eminently sensible use for the technology. And if the machines ever rise up? Well, there&#x27;s always a big STOP button on the top to halt those whirling blades of doom. ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
   A major UK lottery organization says it has resolved a technical error that exposed customer data to other users.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery (PPL) subscribers briefly saw other players&#x27; personal information when logging into the site on Monday. The exposed data included names, addresses, email addresses, and dates of birth.
  &lt;/p&gt;

<title> Cyberpunks mess with Canada&#x27;s water, energy, and farm systems </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/hacktivists_canadian_ics_systems/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 23:28:45 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Hacktivists have breached Canadian critical infrastructure systems to meddle with controls that could have led to dangerous conditions, marking the latest in a string of real-world intrusions driven by online activists rather than spies.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts-advisories/al25-016-internet-accessible-industrial-control-systems-ics-abused-hacktivists&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    a joint alert issued this week
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said industrial control systems (ICS) had been manipulated by hacktivists – not for money, but for the thrill and headlines.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The victims included a municipal water facility where pressure values were changed, an oil and gas company whose tank gauge was tampered with, and a farm silo where drying temperatures were altered, &quot;resulting in potentially unsafe conditions if not caught on time.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Officials stressed these weren&#x27;t sophisticated, state-sponsored operations but opportunistic intrusions that caused real-world disruption ranging from false alarms to degraded service. The attackers didn&#x27;t need custom malware or insider access either – just a connection and curiosity.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;While individual organizations may not be direct targets of adversaries, they may become victims of opportunity as hacktivists are increasingly exploiting internet-accessible ICS devices to gain media attention, discredit organizations, and undermine Canada&#x27;s reputation,&quot; the alert said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The advisory listed a depressingly familiar roll call of vulnerable kit: PLCs, remote terminal units, human-machine interfaces, SCADA systems, safety controllers, building management setups, and other industrial IoT gear that&#x27;s notoriously fragile when left exposed. Operators were urged to take stock of what&#x27;s online, lock it down behind VPNs and multi-factor authentication, and monitor it like a critical system – because it is.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The US government has
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/09/25/threat-actors-continue-exploit-otics-through-unsophisticated-means&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    previously
   &lt;/a&gt;
   sounded the alarm on foreign hacktivists attempting to manipulate industrial system settings. Earlier this month, a Russian group called
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/russia_hacktivists_honeytrap/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    TwoNet was duped into targeting a fake critical infrastructure organisation
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , which the crew later claimed to be a real-world attack.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

     Iran-linked crew used custom &#x27;cyberweapon&#x27; in US critical infrastructure attacks
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security warned that oversight remains weakest in local utilities, agriculture, and smaller manufacturers, where operational technology often runs for decades and cybersecurity spending trails behind IT. Officials urged operators to meet the country&#x27;s Cyber Security Readiness Goals and to report any suspicious activity.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   So far, the consequences have been mild: pressure fluctuations, false readings, and some red faces. But authorities say the same tactics could easily cause physical harm or cascading failures if repeated at scale.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   It&#x27;s not just industrial kit under fire in Canada. Last week, Toys R Us Canada
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/23/toysrus_canada_data_leak/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    admitted
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that crooks had lifted customer data, including names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, and dumped it online. No credit card details were taken, but the breach shows that whether it&#x27;s water pumps or toy shops, Canada&#x27;s digital front doors aren&#x27;t as locked as they should be. ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

<title> AI blew open software security, now OpenAI wants to fix it with an agent called Aardvark </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/openai_aardvark_agentic_security/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 19:43:56 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   After helping expand the modern software attack surface with the rise of AI services prone to data poisoning and prompt injection, OpenAI has thrown a bone to cyber defenders.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The maker of ChatGPT on Thursday announced that it is privately testing Aardvark, an agentic security system based on GPT‑5.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Aardvark represents a breakthrough in AI and security research: an autonomous agent that can help developers and security teams discover and fix security vulnerabilities at scale,&quot; the company said in
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/index/introducing-aardvark/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    its post
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . &quot;Aardvark is now available in
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openai.com/form/aardvark-beta-signup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    private beta
   &lt;/a&gt;
   to validate and refine its capabilities in the field.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A software agent is an AI model with access to other software tools that tries to address a particular task. That
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/22/openai_defends_atlas_as_prompt/&quot;&gt;
    potentially toxic relationship
   &lt;/a&gt;
   has helped spawn
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?industry=Security&amp;query=AI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    dozens of AI security startups
   &lt;/a&gt;
   and
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=security+risks+posed+by+large+language+models+site%253Aarxiv.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    too many research papers
   &lt;/a&gt;
   about
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/zenity_ai_agent_security_summit_recap/&quot;&gt;
    the security risks posed by large language models
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Aardvark might just undo some of the harm that has arisen from vibe coding with the likes of GPT-5, not to mention the general defect rate of human-authored software. It can scan source code repositories on an ongoing basis to flag vulnerabilities, test the exploitability of code, prioritize bugs by severity, and propose fixes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;

     &#x27;Keep Android Open&#x27; movement fights back against Google sideloading restrictions
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Aardvark does not rely on traditional program analysis techniques like fuzzing or software composition analysis,&quot; according to OpenAI. &quot;Instead, it uses LLM-powered reasoning and tool-use to understand code behavior and identify vulnerabilities. Aardvark looks for bugs as a human security researcher might: by reading code, analyzing it, writing and running tests, using tools, and more.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   But unlike a human, Aardvark just runs and runs. It can&#x27;t be bargained with; it can&#x27;t be reasoned with. It doesn&#x27;t feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop unless you&#x27;ve set up an OpenAI API budget limit, your credit card expires, or the AI bubble pops and takes us all down with it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   According to OpenAI, Aardvark is quite effective. The company says its AI animal has been rooting around in its internal codebases and those of external alpha test partners for several months. For OpenAI, the agentic beast &quot;surfaced meaningful vulnerabilities and contributed to OpenAI&#x27;s defensive posture.&quot; And in benchmark testing on &quot;golden&quot; (authoritative) repos, it has flagged 92 percent of known and synthetically introduced vulnerabilities.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   When unleashed on open-source projects, Aardvark has sniffed out at least ten vulnerabilities worthy of a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   That&#x27;s somewhat less than
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/07/google_deepmind_patches_holes/&quot;&gt;
    72 security fixes
   &lt;/a&gt;
   Google claims that its CodeMender AI system has managed, or the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/20/google_ossfuzz/&quot;&gt;
    26 flaws
   &lt;/a&gt;
   found by Google&#x27;s OSS-Fuzz project a year ago.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   As to whether Aardvark really represents &quot;a breakthrough,&quot; we may know more once it has been made publicly available and the critter can be evaluated against the many existing AI-flavored security tools that have emerged in recent years, such as
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/curl_project_swamped_with_ai/&quot;&gt;
    ZeroPath
   &lt;/a&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;

<title> Datacenter biz and nuke startup join forces for Texas AI ranch </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/datacenter_biz_and_nuke_startup/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 19:28:54 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Texas is set to get another nuclear-powered datacenter project thanks to Blue Energy and Crusoe, but any atomic action isn&#x27;t likely until the next decade.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The two firms have announced plans to develop an AI campus located in the Port of Victoria, Texas, just down the gulf coast from Houston.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Under the deal,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://blueenergy.co/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Blue Energy
   &lt;/a&gt;
   has secured a site on which it will build and operate an advanced nuclear power plant with a generating capacity of up to 1.5 gigawatts (GW), which will provide the juice for a nearby location where
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crusoe.ai/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Crusoe
   &lt;/a&gt;
   will construct the AI bit barns.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The 1,600-acre (about 6.5 square kilometers) site in Victoria County was chosen for its location, existing infrastructure, and available energy resources to support a gigawatt-scale datacenter campus, the pair say, close to electric transmission lines, fiber networks, and natural gas pipelines.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Blue Energy claims that it will use a &quot;natural gas bridge&quot; to deliver power to the Crusoe campus by 2028, transitioning to nuclear generation by 2031.  What this means in practice is that the plant and turbine hall will be burning gas to generate power in three years&#x27; time, while the nuclear part of the site is still being built and licensed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The company says that it will be able to reduce the build time and costs of its nuclear reactors by prefabricating them from existing parts made via fixed-price contracting at existing fab yards and shipyards, then assembling them on site. This cuts down the amount of reinforced concrete and simplifies construction that has previously plagued nuclear projects, it claims.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;This partnership with AI infrastructure leader Crusoe marks a key milestone for Blue Energy as we work to meet rising global energy demand and, for the first time in the nuclear industry&#x27;s history, build a plant with cost and schedule certainty,&quot; Blue Energy CEO and Co-Founder Jake Jurewicz said in a supplied remark.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   However, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, as the saying goes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Blue Energy is relying on light water reactor (LWR) technology combined with what it says are the latest passive safety features – the reactor building itself is submerged in a pool - to create a plant that it claims will be &quot;walk-away safe.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Crusoe, meanwhile, is a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crusoe.ai/resources/newsroom/crusoe-announces-series-e-funding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    venture-backed startup
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that recently rose to prominence by building out the first datacenter
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crusoe.ai/resources/newsroom/crusoe-announces-flagship-abilene-data-center-is-live&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Abilene, Texas
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , for
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/24/openai_oracle_softbank_datacenters/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Project Stargate
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , the massive years-long collaboration between OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank to build a network of huge AI datacenters around the world. Crusoe styles itself as an &quot;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/nvidia_omniverse_dsx/&quot;&gt;
    AI factory
   &lt;/a&gt;
   company&quot; and says that its vertically integrated model spanning energy sourcing, datacenter design and construction, plus a custom cloud platform allows it to build large-scale facilities faster and more cost-effectively than before. As evidence, it points to the first phase of the Abilene datacenter going live just one year after construction began.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Victoria County has not been previously mentioned as a potential site for Stargate, and the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crusoe.ai/resources/newsroom/blue-energy-and-crusoe-partner-to-develop-nuclear-powered-ai-data-center&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

     Small nuke reactors are really coming online by next year, US energy secretary insists
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Powering the AI revolution requires us to rethink energy, and Crusoe is dedicated to building the infrastructure to make it happen,&quot; said the firm&#x27;s veep for Energy Infrastructure and Development, Andrew Likens in a canned statement.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Rethinking energy appears to mean burning fossil fuels until you can bring enough nuclear reactor capacity online to power all that hot and hungry infrastructure, as advised by datacenter infrastructure biz
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/25/schneider_exec_dc_power/&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;
   last year. Nuclear is emerging as the carbon-free power source of choice for the tech industry&#x27;s AI ambitions, but as
   &lt;i&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/i&gt;
   explained earlier this year,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/31/nuclear_no_panacea_ai/&quot;&gt;
    new capacity takes years to build
   &lt;/a&gt;
   and bring online.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This Port of Victoria project isn&#x27;t the only nuclear datacenter in Texas; South Korean industrial giant Hyundai is set to build a reactor to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/fermi_america_nuclear_datacenter/&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Is installing Windows 11 with a local account or on unsupported hardware harmful or dangerous? YouTube&#x27;s AI moderation system seems to think so, as it has started pulling videos that show users how to sidestep Microsoft&#x27;s setup restrictions.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Tech YouTuber Rich White, aka CyberCPU Tech, was the first to go public about the issue on October 26, when he posted a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6p6g0-JUNA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    video
   &lt;/a&gt;
   reporting the removal of a how-to he published on installing Windows 11 25H2 with a local account instead of a Microsoft account. In the video, White expressed concern that YouTube&#x27;s automated flagging process may be the root of the problem, as he found it hard to believe that &quot;creating a local account in Windows 11 could lead to serious harm or even death,&quot; as YouTube reportedly alleged when it removed the video.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   When he appealed, White said that YouTube denied the request within 10 to 20 minutes, early on a Sunday morning, which led him to speculate that there wasn&#x27;t a human in the loop when the request was shut down. That wasn&#x27;t his only video removed, either.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The next day, White uploaded his video for this week on installing Windows 11 25H2 on unsupported hardware, which was removed hours after being posted. YouTube justified the removal on similar grounds. As was the case with the first removal, White appealed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;The appeal was denied at 11:55, a full one minute after submitting it,&quot; White explained in a video following up on both removals. &quot;If this was reviewed by a real human like YouTube claims they are, they watched a 17-minute video and denied the appeal in one minute.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   At least two other YouTubers -
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFzTjrNYggo&amp;t=212s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Britec09
   &lt;/a&gt;
   and
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KLYIJqgPz4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Hrutkay Mods
   &lt;/a&gt;
   - have released videos alleging much of the same: They published content about Windows workarounds, YouTube removed them, and they had an impossible time getting to a human for any help. YouTube&#x27;s AI, all three contend, blocked their videos, despite the fact that bypassing Windows 11 locks is neither illegal nor dangerous for people who follow the instructions.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Sure, you might muck up your Windows machine, but no one is going to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2MY89SZ3Tjg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    lose a finger
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve spoken with a single human being from Google or YouTube yet since this started,&quot; White told us in an email. &quot;It&#x27;s been all automated.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
   Is Microsoft tipping the scales?
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   White speculated in one of his videos about the takedowns that Microsoft may have been trying to exert pressure on Google to have the videos taken down. Neither Microsoft nor Google has responded to our questions on the matter, so while that prospect remains speculative, there is a timing element that&#x27;s quite coincidental. Microsoft
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/07/windows_11_local_account_loophole/&quot;&gt;
    just closed
   &lt;/a&gt;
   the local account loophole for Windows 11 setup in its most recent insider build.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   That&#x27;s not the only loophole that Microsoft has been trying to quiet down, either. In February, Redmond
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/05/windows_11_hardware_requirement_workaround/&quot;&gt;
    took down its own advice
   &lt;/a&gt;
   on how to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware without Trusted Platform Module 2.0 hardware in a bid to get people to stop doing that and just
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/08/windows_10_precious_metals/&quot;&gt;
    buy new hardware
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . Coincidentally or not, that&#x27;s the topic of White&#x27;s and others&#x27; removed videos.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Odd timing aside, White doesn&#x27;t believe Microsoft&#x27;s malfeasance was part of the takedowns despite his publicly speculating on that in one of his videos.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;I mentioned in one of the videos I made regarding this issue the possibility of Microsoft&#x27;s involvement,&quot; White told us. &quot;That was spoken more out of frustration and confusion over the whole issue and I just don&#x27;t think Microsoft had anything to do with it.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This problem, he explained, is more about AI inappropriately flagging content and YouTube not having the manpower to deal with appeals.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   It could go further than just a few removed videos, though. All three channels we identified expressed far more concern about the chilling effect AI moderation without a human in the loop can have on free expression on YouTube.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;The number of creators currently being affected reaches far further than the ones that have had videos taken down like I have because creators have voiced fear in what we are allowed to publish,&quot; White explained.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The CyberCPU vlogger explained that YouTube didn&#x27;t provide any actual explanation about what his videos did to violate the site&#x27;s content policy, leaving him and other tech creators in a position where anything they publish could result in a strike against their channel and eventual removal.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;My fear is this could lead to many creators fearing covering more moderate to advanced tutorials,&quot; White told us, adding that such self-censorship would inevitably lead to less engagement. &quot;Another creator shared that sentiment with me because he had been posting more &#x27;safe&#x27; videos since this ordeal started and his views have suffered from it.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Ultimately, the tech YouTubers waging this campaign seem to simply want an explanation and clarity.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We would just like YouTube to tell us what the issue is,&quot; White said. &quot;If it&#x27;s just a mistake then fine, restore our videos and we&#x27;ll move on. If it&#x27;s a new policy on YouTube, then tell us where the line is and hopefully we can move forward.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Operating blind isn&#x27;t going to work,&quot; White concluded in his message to us.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Welcome to the age of AI moderation - here&#x27;s hoping you don&#x27;t trip the system with no way to appeal. ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

<title> Microsoft Task Manager now tasking PCs with running multiple copies of itself </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/microsoft_has_managed_to_break/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:47:02 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft&#x27;s ability to add bugs in the most unexpected of places has continued into its latest update to Windows 11, which spawns multiple copies of Task Manager, sucking down resources you&#x27;d normally use Task Manager to kill.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The issue, which turned up in the non-security preview update for Windows 11 (
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/october-28-2025-kb5067036-os-builds-26200-7019-and-26100-7019-preview-ec3da7dc-63ba-4b1d-ac41-cf2494d2123a&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    KB5067036
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ), manifests itself as multiple versions of the utility.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Close the process killer via the close button on the window, and then reopen it, and... a new process is spawned. While initially amusing, it can quickly consume resources, particularly for users (such as this writer) who are accustomed to using the Task Manager to terminate errant processes.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The previous incarnations of Task Manager, which reside in the background list, can be terminated with a single click of End Process, but it is disconcerting to see the list increase every time Task Manager is opened.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/10/31/task_manager_bug.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;How many Task Managers? (pic: Richard Speed)&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/10/31/task_manager_bug.jpg?x=648&amp;y=319&amp;infer_y=1&quot; title=&quot;Too many task managers (pic: Richard Speed)&quot; width=&quot;648&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;

    Too many task managers (pic: Richard Speed) - Click to enlarge
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   It&#x27;s not clear precisely what is happening, but it might be connected to a fix rolling out in the update for Task Manager: &quot;Some apps might unexpectedly not be grouped with their processes.&quot; If somebody were tinkering with Task Manager, we&#x27;d hope a thorough dose of testing would be administered afterward. But then again, this is Microsoft, and the company has a particular reputation when it comes to quality control, as many an administrator looking glumly at their

  &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/i&gt;
   asked Microsoft if this was expected behavior or a bug introduced with this update, but the company has yet to respond. According to the known issues list, the company says, &quot;Microsoft is not currently aware of any issues with this update.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Over on X (formerly Twitter), the

    author of the original Task Manager
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , Dave Plummer,

    commented
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , &quot;Code so good, it refuses to die!&quot; It&#x27;s unclear how much of Plummer&#x27;s code remains in the current iteration of the Task Manager. We&#x27;d wager not much, since Plummer comes from an era at Microsoft when applications needed to be lean and mean, rather than buggy and bloated.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Plummer told
   &lt;em&gt;
    El Reg
   &lt;/em&gt;
   , &quot;You could always run the NT4 task manager, it still works! But it can only display the first 8 CPUs, then it wraps the others into those graphs. So if you have 16 cores, each graph represents TWO cpus.  But that it works at all is kinda neat. Other than that, not sure what they broke or why it went wrong! There&#x27;s some code in Task Manager that causes it to hide when you press ESC instead of exiting, maybe they broke that!&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft is unlikely to issue an out-of-band update to fix this particular bit of borkage, which only affects a subset of users, as it is one part of a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/microsofts_new_windows_start_menu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    bunch of changes
   &lt;/a&gt;
   subject to a gradual rollout. However, the spawning of zombie or dead Task Manager processes evokes a particular

   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   That said, there is nothing prestigious about releasing an update with such an obvious oversight. ®

<title> Proton trains new service to expose corporate infosec cover-ups </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/proton_data_breach_observatory/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:18:54 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Some orgs would rather you not know when they&#x27;ve suffered a cyberattack, but a new platform from privacy-focused tech firm Proton will shine a light on the big breaches that might otherwise stay buried.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Launched on Thursday, Proton&#x27;s Data Breach Observatory aims to scour the dark web for details of breaches that don&#x27;t reach the likes of regulators&#x27; portals, or those that the affected organization simply hasn&#x27;t acknowledged.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Proton said in its
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://proton.me/blog/introducing-breach-observatory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    announcement
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that the Data Breach Observatory will launch with a roundup of 2025&#x27;s incidents to date, identifying 300 million individual records across 794 attacks.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Excluded from these are the often lofty figures associated with
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/29/infostealers_increased_use/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    infostealer dumps
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , which typically garner the clickiest headlines but concern data that is
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/gmail_breach_fake_news/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    routinely duplicated, old, or otherwise mundane
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Data Breach Observatory will feature only attacks that targeted lone organizations rather than such aggregated cases. Without this exclusion, the number of incidents it would have collected would be nearly double, and the number of affected records would be in the hundreds of billions, Proton said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Swiss privacy biz said there isn&#x27;t enough transparency around data breaches, and there is a growing market on the dark web for stolen details, such as credentials and sensitive personal information.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In 49 percent of cases examined so far this year, passwords featured among the leaked datasets, and sensitive stuff like records related to government services or healthcare were found in more than a third (34 percent).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Proton is aiming to update its Data Breach Observatory in near-real time, and responsibly disclose the attacks it finds on the dark web that may otherwise never have gotten the airtime they deserve.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The new service wasn&#x27;t launched to simply harangue orgs for keeping shtum when they could be more transparent. Proton said it believes the Observatory will help small and medium businesses, which remain the most vulnerable to data breaches, become more aware of the dangers and shore up their systems accordingly.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Eamonn Maguire, director of engineering, AI &amp; ML, at Proton, insists that the Data Breach Observatory is different from sites like HaveIBeenPwned, and the fact that it ingests data from dark web sources sets it apart from others like it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   He told
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   : &quot;Many breach disclosures come from other sources too: GDPR notifications, researchers, threat intelligence feeds, and journalistic investigations, and so on. However, there&#x27;s still a significant gap: many organizations choose not to disclose breaches when not legally required, or delay disclosure.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Our Observatory fills this gap by monitoring criminal sources directly, meaning we can identify breaches regardless of whether the organization affected chooses transparency. The key differentiation is systematic, near-real-time monitoring of criminal sources rather than waiting for eventual disclosure.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Scouring the dark web for this kind of intel is not a novel endeavor, although publicizing results of those investigations is less common.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Dark web breach data is made available to customers of threat intelligence companies, for example, but these are often private reports, so the wider business community rarely benefits.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
   In addition, data circulating on the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/19/mi6_darkweb_portal_upgrade/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    dark web
   &lt;/a&gt;
   is often unreliable and thus must be screened. You can&#x27;t just take the word of a cybercriminal and run with it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Using
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/03/scattered_lapsus_hunters_latest_leak/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    ransomware leak blogs
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , from which big cybersecurity companies commonly gather statistics to inform their quarterly reports on the number of attacks, is problematic, because these sites routinely
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/04/christies_stolen_data_auctioned_off/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    inflate their claims
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Asked how Proton plans to ensure the veracity of the data it finds, Maguire said that the company has partnered with US-based Constella Intelligence, which will handle this part of the process.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;There are a number of processes that go into this,&quot; he said. &quot;For example, cross-referencing compares against known breach patterns and previous leaks. Similarly, metadata examination analyzes timestamps, file structures and other metadata for consistency, and company outreach plays a part too.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Part of our responsible disclosure process includes contacting affected companies, which often provides confirmation. You&#x27;re absolutely right that ransomware leak sites can include duplicated or inflated data, which is precisely why we focus on single-source, identifiable breaches and exclude aggregated compilations. We&#x27;re not simply republishing what criminals claim; we&#x27;re applying validation layers before disclosure.&quot; ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title> Developer puts Windows 7 on a crash diet, drops it to down to 69 MB </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/windows_7_limbos_down_to/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:18:51 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Stripping Windows to the bare essentials is a favorite hobby among enthusiasts, especially as Microsoft continues loading its OS with unwanted bloat. The latest achievement is Windows 7 being reduced to 69 MB.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A user going by the handle of @XenoPanther on X (formerly Twitter) has
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/XenoPanther/status/1983477707968291075&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    published
   &lt;/a&gt;
   a file list.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;This was more of a fun proof of concept rather than something usable,&quot; @XenoPanther
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/XenoPanther/status/1983477707968291075&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    said
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . &quot;Virtually nothing can run due to critical missing files such as common dialog boxes and common controls.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Windows 7 desktop does boot - barely – and
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/XenoPanther/status/1983581752279838854&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &quot;At least the genuine check is still intact.&quot;
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   We&#x27;d quibble with the &quot;virtually nothing&quot; assertion. Anything with a graphical user interface would struggle, but would it be a problem to run a basic CLI app that only needed the Windows kernel?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The accomplishment is the latest in a tradition of &quot;getting Windows to run in as little space as possible.&quot; This writer fondly remembers coaxing Windows 3.1 onto a floppy disk simply because it was possible.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

     No account? No Windows 11, Microsoft says as another loophole snaps shut
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;

     Microsoft keeps adding stuff into Windows we don&#x27;t want – here&#x27;s what we actually need
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/windows_11_25h2/&quot;&gt;
     Windows 11 25H2 is mostly 24H2 with bits bolted on or ripped out
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   However, there are legitimate reasons for wanting to reduce the footprint of Windows: reducing the size of virtual machines or container requirements, for instance. In 2015, Microsoft showed off a version of Windows Server –
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2015/05/01/microsoft_nano_server_deep_dive/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Nano Server
   &lt;/a&gt;
   – with a disk footprint of 400 MB.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/containers/nano-server-x-server-core-x-server---which-base-image-is-the-right-one-for-you/2835785&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    later
   &lt;/a&gt;
   discontinued the Nano Server option to focus on the Nano Server base container image, which weighed in at less than 300 MB. That&#x27;s ideal for swift pulls, but less good for anything that needs more than the very limited APIs available.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   If only Microsoft would consider shrinking its flagship desktop operating system rather than leaving it to developers like NTDEV and the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/11/nano11_cuts_windows_11_down/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Tiny11 series of slimmed-down Windows 11 installations
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While Windows 7 is long obsolete, a 69 MB stub with selective files could prove useful for running legacy software without wasting space on a full install.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The weekend weather is looking a little crappy here in the UK, so attempting to beat @XenoPanther&#x27;s record seems a fun way to pass the hours.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Why? Because it&#x27;s there. ®

<title> International Criminal Court kicks Microsoft Office to the curb </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/international_criminal_court_ditches_office/</link>

<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The International Criminal Court (ICC) is ditching Microsoft Office for a European software alternative amid mounting fears about being reliant on US technology.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The ICC will switch from Microsoft&#x27;s productivity wares to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendesk.eu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    openDesk
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , an open source office and collaboration suite provided by the Center for Digital Sovereignty (
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zendis.de/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    ZenDiS
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The ICC confirmed the migration
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   , but a spokesperson declined to comment further.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The move follows heightened European unease about relying on American tech giants - particularly as the Trump administration has wielded punitive measures against perceived adversaries.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   President Trump signed an
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-sanctions-on-the-international-criminal-court/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    executive order
   &lt;/a&gt;
   in February to sanction ICC officials over arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu connected to alleged war crimes in Gaza.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   ICC&#x27;s Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan reportedly
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/icc-trump-sanctions-karim-khan-court-a4b4c02751ab84c09718b1b95cbd5db3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    lost access to his Microsoft email account
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . Microsoft President Brad Smith denied the company had done this,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/microsoft-did-not-cut-services-international-criminal-court-president-american-sanctions-trump-tech-icc-amazon-google/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    telling reporters
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &quot;at no point did Microsoft cease or suspend its services to the ICC.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While concerns over US tech might be growing, efforts to find alternatives to Microsoft isn&#x27;t new. The German city of Munich famously decided to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2013/12/16/munich_signs_off_on_open_source_project/&quot;&gt;
    go open source
   &lt;/a&gt;
   many years ago, adopting Linux on its PCs and servers and LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office, although it
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2017/11/13/munich_committee_says_all_windows_2020/&quot;&gt;
    reverted to Windows
   &lt;/a&gt;
   in 2020.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   More recently, the German state of
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/04/germanys_northernmost_state_ditches_windows/&quot;&gt;
    Schleswig-Holstein
   &lt;/a&gt;
   last year went public on a project to dump Microsoft for Linux and LibreOffice and

    completed the migration of 40,000 accounts this month
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Existing concerns about
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/26/europe_has_second_thoughts_about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    over-reliance on US tech services
   &lt;/a&gt;
   intensified after the latest outages at

   &lt;/a&gt;
   under the US Cloud Act — which allows Washington access to data held by American companies regardless of location.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   asked ZenDiS for comment and if it was willing to disclose the value of the ICC deal.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A spokesperson at Microsoft told us: &quot;We value our relationship with the ICC as a customer and are convinced that nothing impedes our ability to continue providing services to the ICC in the future.&quot; ®
  &lt;/p&gt;

<title> Meta to sell $30B in bonds to build AI datacenters </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/meta_launches_30_billion_bond/</link>

<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Even the world&#x27;s richest companies need outside help to fulfill their datacenter dreams. Now, Meta is selling $30 billion in bonds to build out its infrastructure estate and support its ambition in AI markets. Some of these won&#x27;t mature for 40 years.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The social media giant — owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram — launched the bond sale in
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312525258837/d61769dfwp.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    an SEC filing
   &lt;/a&gt;
   last night with the help of banks Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. It comes as major cloud and infrastructure vendors announce ballooning capital investment plans to keep pace in the race for AI datacenter capacity.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Meta bonds were issued in six parts with varying interest rates and maturity between 2030 and 2065.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Earlier this week, Meta posted $51.2 billion in revenue for its calendar Q3, up 26 percent year-on-year. Susan Li, Chief Financial Officer, told investors that its quarterly capital expenditure was at $19.4 billion, “driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure”.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “Our primary focus is deploying capital to support the company&#x27;s highest order priorities including developing leading AI products, models, and business solutions. As we make significant investments in infrastructure to support this work, we are focused on preserving maximum long-term flexibility to ensure we can meet our future capacity needs while also being able to respond to how the market develops in the years ahead,” she said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Li noted that Meta currently expects 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion, increased from its prior outlook of $66 billion to $72 billion. In 2024,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    the figure was $39.23 billion
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   As well as issuing bonds,

    Meta has entered a joint venture
   &lt;/a&gt;
   with Blue Owl Capital to fund its datacenter building.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The fund will own an 80 percent interest while Meta will retain the remaining 20 percent ownership of the JV which is set to spend $27 billion on buildings, power, cooling, and connectivity for the Hyperion datacenter campus. A portion of capital raised will be funded by debt issued through a private securities offering.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/alphabet_capex/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    an escalation in the datacenter arms race
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that cloud and AI companies say is necessary to stake their claim to the future of AI. Google’s capital expenditure is set to triple in two years to hit $93 billion in 2025; in 2023, it stood at $32.25 billion. Microsoft’s spending for the most recent quarter will be $34.9 billion, up from $24 billion the previous quarter. Amy Hood, Microsoft executive veep and CFO, said growth in capital expenditure would be higher next year.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Oracle is also getting in on the act. Estimates suggest it will need to borrow $100 billion over four years to fulfill the demand of its $300 billion cloud compute contract with OpenAI. It has already launched an $18 billion bond sale and reports suggest it plans another $38 billion debt offering.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Credit traders are now
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/oracles-credit-default-swaps-rise-as-ai-investments-grow-93CH-4316658&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    purchasing protection against Oracle defaulting on its borrowing
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , according to reports. Data from ICE Data Services said the cost of such insurance — in the form of credit default swaps — over the next five years is near its highest level since October 2023.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    management consultancy Bain &amp; Company said
   &lt;/a&gt;
   the industry would need to spend $500 billion per annum on building datacenters to create the extra 100 gigawatts of capacity in the US needed by 2030 to meet demand for AI. ®

<title> The clock&#x27;s ticking for MySQL 8.0 as end of life looms </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/mysql_8_support_end/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:08:59 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Users have six months to migrate from MySQL 8.0 if they are to stay on a supported version of the open source database, or face security and reliability risks.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Percona, a provider of open source database support services and Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), has warned that more than half its MySQL instances remain on MySQL 8.0, support for
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://endoflife.date/mysql#:~:text=LTS%20releases%20have%20a%205,well%20before%20EOL%20of%208.0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    which ends on April 30, 2026
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Peter Zaitsev, Percona co-founder, told
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   : &quot;Every piece of complex software has bugs which may not have been found yet. Some of those bugs are also security bugs. These are the most problematic: when you have software which is not supported, not maintained, that means those bugs are not going to be fixed anymore.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Data from PMM, Percona&#x27;s open source database management tool, shows that 58 percent of MySQL and MariaDB (a MySQL fork) instances are running MySQL 8.0, while 18.8 percent are running 5.7, which
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/11/mysql_5_7_support/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    went out of support in 2023
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While users might put off database migration because of the disruption involved, they should be aware that the upgrade from MySQL 8.0 to 8.4 – the most recent stable version – is not nearly so onerous as the upgrade from 5.7 to 8.0. &quot;It was a very big and painful jump,&quot; Zaitsev told us.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   MySQL has seen its popularity suffer in recent years, with its rating on the logarithmic
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://db-engines.com/en/ranking&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    DB-Engines
   &lt;/a&gt;
   scale falling off such that PostgreSQL may overtake it in the not-too-distant future, although it remains second to Oracle. Microsoft SQL Server is third, and like MySQL its popularity is also declining. On the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology#1-databases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Stack Overflow Developer Survey
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , MySQL remains in second place, used by around 40 percent of professional developers, a long way behind PostgreSQL, which is used by 55 percent.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Sun Microsystems bought MySQL
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2008/01/16/sun_buys_mysql/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    in 2008
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , and Oracle absorbed both
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2009/04/20/oracle_eats_sun/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    the following year
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . Despite being seen as a reasonable custodian of the open source database, which was a pillar of the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/06/30_years_mysql/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    popular LAMP stack through the 2000s
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , more recently
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/11/early_mysql_engineer_questions_whether/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Oracle&#x27;s long-term dedication to the system was questioned
   &lt;/a&gt;
   as it focuses on analytics DBaaS HeatWave, which is based on MySQL.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In September,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/11/oracle_slammed_for_mysql_job/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Oracle was reported to have made widespread layoffs
   &lt;/a&gt;
   in the MySQL engineering team. Big Red declined to comment at the time.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Is Oracle saying they are reducing investment in open source MySQL, reducing features and so on? I think that has been escalating. It has been really brutal. I spoke to a number of people who had left the company, and some of them estimated as many as 60 or 70 percent of the engineering team has gone,&quot; Zaitsev claimed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While users might consider migrating to MariaDB, which was forked from MySQL in 2009, or PostgreSQL, there is a migration cost. &quot;The difference between MariaDB and MySQL 8.0 is much more significant than 8.0 and 8.4, so you should prepare for more work,&quot; Zaitsev said. ®

<title> Resilience, not sovereignty, defines OpenStack&#x27;s next chapter </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/resilience_openinfra_summit/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 11:40:46 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Sovereignty might be the word of the hour, but the OpenStack community has another – resilience.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;It&#x27;s about independence and control,&quot; said Thierry Carrez, general manager at the OpenInfra Foundation. &quot;It&#x27;s not a feature, it&#x27;s really a state. You&#x27;re sovereign if you have some control and some independence from others&quot; - whether those are countries or companies.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   These &quot;others&quot; might be countries or companies. If an organization has a dependency, &quot;then there is some risk.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Carrez cited the VMware situation under Broadcom, where customers faced substantial price rises, and geopolitical uncertainties that have forced enterprises and governments to scrutinize their dependencies. Both may have given OpenStack an unexpected boost.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A large chunk of the OpenInfra Summit in Paris this month was devoted to VMware migration, with an impressive live demonstration during the keynote showed how the process could be (though nothing is ever as simple as a rehearsed demo suggests).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Open source relicensing, such as Redis&#x27;s move to a less permissive license that led to the Valkey fork, also factored into reassessments. But ultimately, &quot;what people want is more independence from countries we used to rely on, especially in Europe,&quot; Carrez said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Europe has a very strong dependency on US hyperscale providers, services... and they realize now that that dependency is potentially going to be leveraged against them, and so they want more local capacity.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We spent a decade telling developers to ignore infrastructure because &#x27;those hyperscalers are going to solve that for us,&#x27; and now we realize that makes us very vulnerable to a lot of non-desirable outcomes.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Following Kubernetes victory, OpenStack shifted from being a do-everything platform to concentrating on infrastructure – fortunate timing given recent events.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The summit has changed too: &quot;It&#x27;s no longer like 10,000 people. It&#x27;s more like 1,200 people here, but it&#x27;s people that know why they&#x27;re here... They have infrastructure provider concerns.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Compared to previous summits, there is renewed energy, driven in part by external events as well as the focus Carrez highlighted.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   It has been an eventful few years for the OpenInfra Foundation. Beyond VMware&#x27;s licensing changes and geopolitical instability, OpenInfra&#x27;s executive director, Jonathan Bryce, was
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-appoints-jonathan-bryce-as-executive-director-cloud-infrastructure-and-chris-aniszczyk-as-cto-cloud-infrastructure-to-oversee-major-open-s-1750718282015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    appointed
   &lt;/a&gt;
   executive director of the Linux Foundation months after OpenInfra joined it. Bryce admitted he&#x27;s leaning heavily on people like Carrez due to the increased workload.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Bryce also addressed the summit&#x27;s third major theme: AI. &quot;What&#x27;s different is that for cloud, it was a strategic initiative from the CTO or CIO,&quot; he said. &quot;But for this, it&#x27;s coming from the CEO and the board.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The classic &quot;we need an AI&quot; from the boss meets the &quot;but what do you want it to do?&quot; question.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Bryce says it&#x27;s all about inference, particularly as agentic workloads demand far more tokens than an occasional AI chats.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;One of the first things we have to get right is inference,&quot; he said. &quot;This is the same kind of thing that we were working on for 10 or 15 years around databases... we&#x27;ve gone through this transition before with telecom workloads,&quot; and here we go again.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   What if the AI bubble bursts? Bryce recalled the dotcom era when suddenly redundant systems were repurposed. &quot;Right now, we need more infrastructure than we can possibly build.&quot; And if the bubble bursts &quot;we might have a moment of spare capacity, but that&#x27;s not going to last very long.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Stig Telfer, CTO at StackHPC, a company specializing in OpenStack and research computing, acknowledged the uncertainty. &quot;What if AI is so much more hyped than it actually is? What if the demand doesn&#x27;t rise to the level where all of the new cloud businesses and all of the existing cloud businesses were buying GPUs in their hundreds of thousands? What happens if suddenly there&#x27;s an immense oversupply in the market?
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Nobody knows... It may be that this is causing people to take more of a wait-and-see approach.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   On community resilience, Bryce pointed to OpenStack&#x27;s track record. &quot;We&#x27;ve gone through this multiple times where companies employing the largest number of contributors changed strategy and moved on.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Resilience, it&#x27;s not just a theoretical term. Our community is structured in a way where we truly are resilient, and I think we&#x27;ve proven that for 15 years&quot; ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

<title> Linux vendors are getting into Ubuntu – and Snap </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/linux_vendors_getting_into_snap/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:50:43 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   More than one Linux-adjacent vendor presented at the Ubuntu Summit, and a small but recurring theme is offering official Snap packages.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Aside from relatively closed platforms such as ChromeOS and ChromeOS Flex, Ubuntu is the closest thing that the Linux world has to an industry standard – and Ubuntu is committed to its snap packaging format. At last week&#x27;s
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com/summit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Ubuntu Summit 25.10
   &lt;/a&gt;
   at Canonical&#x27;s London HQ, one thing from the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-summit-25-10-timetable/65271&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    event program
   &lt;/a&gt;
   struck us: several independent companies talking about how working with Canonical on Ubuntu support made life easier. Notably, this included talking about creating snap packages of their apps to simplify distribution.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   One such talk was
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/shooting-for-the-moonray/67260&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Shooting for the Moonray
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , by Randy Packer from
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dreamworks.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    DreamWorks Animation
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . Another was
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/snapping-privacy-into-place-proton-s-gpl-powered-journey-with-ubuntu/67251&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Snapping Privacy into Place: Proton&#x27;s GPL‑Powered Journey with Ubuntu
   &lt;/a&gt;

    Proton VPN
   &lt;/a&gt;
   CTO
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com/blog/author/samuele-kaplun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Samuele Kaplun
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   And, of course, the dreaded &quot;AI&quot; was unavoidable. Here, too, vendors are buddying up with Canonical. Google and Nvidia cooperated on
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/optimizing-ai-workloads-with-ubuntu-ai-images/67099&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Optimizing AI Workloads with Ubuntu AI images
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . Nvidia&#x27;s Raffaello Bonghi talked about
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/building-smart-robots-with-nvidia-s-open-platforms-for-training-simulation-and-deployment/67246&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Building Smart Robots with Nvidia&#x27;s Open Platforms for Training, Simulation, and Deployment
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . Qualcomm was there to talk about how cooperating with Canonical in moving development upstream helped deliver
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/developer-ready-ubuntu-on-qualcomm-iot-platforms/67111/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Developer ready Ubuntu on Qualcomm IoT Platforms
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . (We came away clutching a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thundercomm.com/product/rubik-pi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    RUBIK Pi 3
   &lt;/a&gt;
   SBC which we may return to review if we can find some non-AI use for the thing.)
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Also in the realm of automated plagiarism engines, earlier this year,
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/30/alibaba_qwen_ai/&quot;&gt;
    reported on Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen LLMs
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . Some of these are available as FOSS, and Canonical&#x27;s Edoardo Barbieri and Farshid Tavakolizadeh talked about deploying them quickly via
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/inference-snaps/67016&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Inference Snaps
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   As DreamWorks&#x27; Randy Packer put it, the company makes movies, not software. That&#x27;s why it made its Moonray MCRT renderer
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmoonray.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    free and open source
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . (MCRT is Monte Carlo Ray Tracing, although its
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmoonray.org/about&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;
   talks about Monte Carlo

     Linux is about to lose a feature – over a personality clash
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   As we wrote after a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/01/aswf_foss_oscars/&quot;&gt;
    talk at last year&#x27;s Summit
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , at an Ubuntu event we weren&#x27;t expecting to see a slide showing that Rocky Linux had some 80 percent of the Linux market in visual effects. Packer said that Moonray &quot;was only designed to build and run on Rocky.&quot; The snap isn&#x27;t available just yet, but once it is, the easy way to run Moonray on anything else will be to install the snap.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   It&#x27;s very hard to get any hard numbers for Linux distribution usage. In 2023, when Debian celebrated its 30th anniversary, we
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/17/debian_turns_30/&quot;&gt;
    looked at some estimated figures
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , which suggested that the Debian family has about five times as many users as the Red Hat family. Of Debian&#x27;s share, some two-thirds are using Ubuntu variants. In China, one of the biggest players, Kylin, is also based on Ubuntu.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In general, happy people don&#x27;t complain. Those with the loudest voices are those who are unhappy or angry about something. From the many comments and posts in various internet communities, it&#x27;s easy to get the impression that Ubuntu and its snap format are widely hated – but we suspect that&#x27;s not really the case. Ubuntu (including variants and spin-offs such as Linux Mint and Zorin OS) represent the default option for most people running Linux. It&#x27;s 12 years since Mark Shuttleworth
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2013/05/30/ubuntus_shuttleworth_microsoft_no_longer_dominates_pc_biz/&quot;&gt;
    closed Ubuntu Bug #1
   &lt;/a&gt;
   – which was that Microsoft dominated the OS market.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Linux really is getting there, but as we&#x27;ve said before, the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/18/linux_desktop_debate/&quot;&gt;
    hard core will continue to maintain
    &lt;em&gt;
     it&#x27;s the wrong kind of Linux
    &lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   As much as any Linux does, Ubuntu just works. Talking to Canonical executives at the event, the company informally estimates that the Snap Store has in the region of ten times the traffic levels shown by
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://flathub.org/en-GB/statistics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    Flathub&#x27;s public statistics
   &lt;/a&gt;
   – but they could not give us any publicly available information to back this up.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   It&#x27;s noticeable that there are no official snaps for some of the big-name Linux freeware apps, such as Google Chrome, or Microsoft&#x27;s Edge or VS Code. On the other hand, Google and Microsoft already produce native
   &lt;code&gt;
    .deb
   &lt;/code&gt;
   packages and run repositories from which the OS can retrieve updates. There is an unofficial Steam client snap, but Valve too offers an official native package, and we&#x27;ve read that because it avoids snap&#x27;s sandboxing, this works better.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Steam client is a significant tool these days: the latest stats from the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protondb.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    ProtonDB
   &lt;/a&gt;
   games database suggests that as we approach the end of 2025,

    Windows Games&#x27; Compatibility on Linux Is at an All-Time High
   &lt;/a&gt;
   :
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    the amount of games that refuse to launch is […] getting very close to just 10 percent. This means that close to 90 percent of Windows games manage to launch on Linux.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Adding up all the variants on the September

   &lt;/a&gt;
   suggests about 20 percent of users are on some form of Ubuntu-based OS. Not bad, when the official hardware – and devices such as the

<title> Sole trader dispatched almost 1M spam texts to hard-up Brits, says watchdog </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/ico_spam_text_fine/</link>

&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Britain&#x27;s data watchdog has fined a sole trader £200,000 for nearly a million spam texts targeting people in debt – almost 20 pence per message.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Bharat Singh Chand sent 966,449 messages about debt solutions and energy saving grants from 383 mobile numbers between December 3, 2023, and July 3, 2024, according to the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO). This resulted in the fine
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/media2/35jfcqk0/mpn-bharat-singh-chand.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    confirmed today
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/17/ico_cold_call_fines/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;call center&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/09/20/shutterstock_call_center.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;h2 title=&quot;ICO slaps penalties on two businesses that collectively made more than 3 million cold calls&quot;&gt;
     Home improvement marketers dial up trouble from regulator
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;
     READ MORE
    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The activities of the Carmarthenshire sole trader, who has appealed against the decision, came to the attention of the regulator during a separate investigation into someone suspected of sending texts on behalf of Chand and giving advice about a SIM farm.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The messages, the ICO claims, didn&#x27;t include a website address or any identifying information about the sender, simply inviting the recipient to reply &quot;YES&quot; to find out more about debt services. Those that replied in the affirmative received a phone call from a company calling themselves &quot;The Debt Relief Team.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   When officials from the ICO visited Chand&#x27;s home with a search warrant on June 11 last year, he denied involvement in the scheme &quot;despite a call script being on open display,&quot; the watchdog said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Other &quot;evidence&quot; included WhatsApp messages between Chand and a third party that involved &quot;discussing excuses to provide to another related ICO investigation&quot; in which he appeared to encourage another person to &quot;lie&quot; in response to a letter sent by the Commissioner.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A whopping 19,138 complaints were received about the spam texts via the 7726 spam reporting service. The ICO penalized Chand, saying he &quot;knowingly and deliberately transmitted or instigated the transmission of 966,449 text messages without valid consent, breaking direct marketing rules.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;

<title> VodafoneThree to offshore UK network jobs to India </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/vodafonethree_to_offshore_uk_network/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:13:39 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   VodafoneThree has told some staff their roles may be offshored to India under new contracts with Ericsson and Nokia – and that employment protections won&#x27;t apply.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Employees in the operator&#x27;s UK Network Development division were last week summoned to calls led by chief network officer Iain Milligan, where they were warned that planning and optimization jobs would be transferred overseas, and permanent staff were &quot;at risk of redundancy.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/14/vodathree_name_postmerger_top_team/&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Contractors, meanwhile, will depart between the end of November and December, depending on their role, while full-timers will leave by the end of January 2026. It&#x27;s not yet known how many individuals have been impacted, but insiders estimate at least 80 roles have been affected so far.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   An internal FAQ seen by
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   explains the changes stem from VodafoneThree&#x27;s £2 billion partnership with Ericsson and Nokia, announced as part of &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s largest privately funded infrastructure projects&quot; to deliver a standalone 5G network.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;As part of our ambition to build the UK&#x27;s best network we have appointed Ericsson and Nokia as our key partners,&quot; the note says, adding that the deal will help meet commitments made to the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority following the Vodafone-Three merger earlier this year.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   However, this has reportedly sparked anger among employees, who were informed that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) – or TUPE – regulations would not apply because the roles are being relocated offshore.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;In our current context, the activity transferring to Ericsson and Nokia will be based in India, therefore TUPE does not apply,&quot; the FAQ states. &quot;Whilst Ericsson and Nokia both have services and employees in European locations, including the UK, the roles impacted will be offshored to India.&quot;

   VodafoneThree said the changes were intended to &quot;accelerate delivery&quot; of its CMA commitments, including to &quot;drive best practice, innovation, and process improvement.&quot; However, the offshoring move has reignited concerns among staff and unions that the merged operator&#x27;s cost-saving plans are coming at the expense of UK jobs.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Milligan, a former Vodafone UK CTO, took charge of network integration and infrastructure following the completion of the Vodafone-Three merger earlier this year,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/14/vodathree_name_postmerger_top_team/&quot;&gt;
    which saw executives from both companies move into senior roles at the newly formed VodaThree brand
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   At the time, the company said the tie-up would &quot;create a best-in-class network team combining deep UK expertise.&quot; That message now rings hollow for those facing redundancy.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   VodafoneThree did not immediately respond to
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   &#x27;s request for comment.

<title> England&#x27;s local government shake-up promises to be a massive tech headache </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/england_local_government_shakeup/</link>

&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The UK government will replace Surrey County Council and its 11 borough and district councils with two new unitary councils, which will provide most local services to the area&#x27;s 1.2 million residents.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Splitting up Surrey is the first part of a massive reorganization of English local government that looks set to soak up the sector&#x27;s technology capacity for years.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Surrey, the first of 21 areas that will undergo local government reorganization (LGR), will move to its new two-council structure on April 1, 2027. The government plans that all other parts of England served by upper-tier county councils and lower-tier borough, city, and district councils, as well as in some cases neighboring unitary councils, will have unitary councils from April 1, 2028.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   More than 200 existing councils are likely to be abolished, meaning that local government technologists will have to merge and in some cases split software and technology used to deliver services and operate organizations. Local authorities provide hundreds of services, with many relying on specialized software chosen by each council.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Lower-tier authorities in county areas have some heavy responsibilities. They collect domestic council tax on behalf of all tiers of local government and the police, manage the electoral rolls used for local and national elections, and run planning systems. For each of these, the successor unitary councils will have to take over legacy software, decide which package to standardize on or whether to choose something new, buy or extend a license, then migrate records, all while continuing to maintain services.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In April 2023, as part of a smaller round of LGR that involved three areas, a new unitary Somerset Council replaced a county council and four districts. It inherited four different electoral management systems from the districts, although three were from the same supplier, iDox, and it was able to migrate to its latest offering in time for elections held that May. It also moved to a single financial system on day one, taking advantage of procurement work carried out by the county council.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   But when profiled by public sector professional organization Socitm&#x27;s
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://socitm.net/resource-hub/updates/in-our-view-issue-43/#toc-main-feature-a-survivors-guide-to-lgr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    In Our View
   &lt;/a&gt;
   magazine earlier this year, Somerset Council had yet to complete the process of moving to a single revenues and benefits system, was still running five legacy planning systems, and had decided to let existing Microsoft licenses come to an end rather than merge them.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In areas that get split into two or more unitaries such as Surrey, successor councils will also have to decide whether to break up county council systems including social care case management and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Alternatively, they can put these systems into shared services, but this can cause problems if the successor councils want to work in different ways.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Some of the new councils, including those in Surrey, will have to deal with fallout from their predecessors&#x27; IT problems. In July 2024,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/16/18_months_late_and_68pc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Surrey County Council
   &lt;/a&gt;
   was criticized for underestimating the complexity of replacing its SAP ERP software with Unit4 after the new system went live 18 months late at a cost of £27.9 million, 68 percent above the original budget.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/21/gloucestershire_rise_with_sap/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

   &lt;/a&gt;
   delayed its move to SAP&#x27;s cloud software by more than a year with costs more than doubling, and

    West Sussex County Council
   &lt;/a&gt;
   used property sales to help fund a move from a 20-year-old SAP system to an Oracle replacement, with costs increasing from £2.6 million to nearly £40 million.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The government justifies the pain of LGR by saying it will speed up planning decisions, improve the running of local public services, and save money.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;With one council in charge in each area, we will see quicker decisions to grow our towns and cities and connect people to opportunity,&quot; local government minister Steve Reed told the leaders of Surrey&#x27;s doomed councils in a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6900953eafec1781f779947a/surrey-lgr-secretary-of-state-letter-to-surrey-leaders.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    letter
   &lt;/a&gt;
   [PDF] dated October 28.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;It will also help reform local public services. Bringing services like housing, public health, and social care under one roof means one council can see the full picture and spot problems early.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The split is also certain to keep resident tech pros busy for some time. ®
  &lt;/p&gt;

<title> O2 cranks prices mid-contract, essentially telling customers to like it or lump it </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/ofcom_o2_price_hike/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 08:40:14 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Britian&#x27;s comms regulator has criticized O2 for hiking prices beyond what customers agreed to, exploiting a loophole in rules designed to end unpredictable mid-contract increases.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Millions of subscribers to the O2 network – now merged with Virgin Media as VMO2 – could face bills rising up to 40 percent more than expected from April 2026, a move Ofcom called disappointing.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;This goes against the spirit of our rules which are designed to ensure greater certainty and transparency for customers when they sign up,&quot; an Ofcom spokesperson told
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   New regulations that took effect in January 2025 banned inflation-linked price rises for new contracts, requiring providers to specify increases upfront in pounds and pence. But the rules also give customers penalty-free exit rights if prices rise beyond agreed terms — and O2 is using this as cover for bigger increases.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We want customers to have certainty about their monthly mobile bills so they can plan their household budgets,&quot; Ofcome told us. &quot;That&#x27;s why earlier this year we banned unpredictable price rises linked to inflation and instead required providers to tell customers upfront in pounds and pence about any increases in their contract.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Inflation-linked price variation terms became increasingly common in recent years. Many providers made annual price rises linked to inflation, plus an additional fixed percentage on top (often an extra 3.9 percent).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Financial expert Martin Lewis
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/MartinSLewis/status/1983256100574015824&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    warned
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that O2 is following Sky&#x27;s playbook: &quot;while impacted customers can leave penalty-free — and many should — we know few will. Most will likely just suck up a rise that was more than they were told when they signed up.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The big concern, as Lewis states, is that other mobile providers will feel emboldened to follow in O2&#x27;s footsteps and simply roll out a mid-contract price rise, telling customers to leave if they don&#x27;t like it.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   PP Foresight telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore agreed, telling
   &lt;i&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/i&gt;
   that O2 is pushing the boundaries of what the regulator stipulated. He said the mobile operator should focus on &quot;retaining customers in a cutthroat market.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   O2&#x27;s latest quarterly earnings revealed that mobile revenue dipped one percent to £1.43 billion ($1.88 billion).
  &lt;/p&gt;

    commenter on X
   &lt;/a&gt;
   pointed out that for many users their device will be part of their contract, and so leaving would complicate matters.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;For those still paying off their device, they can only cancel penalty-free if they pay that bill off in full – which many won&#x27;t be able to afford to do either within the 30-day time limit or on top of another monthly plan elsewhere,&quot; the post states.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   For its part, O2 defended the move by saying that demand for mobile data was at an all-time high. It pointed out an annual rise of £2.50 per month equated to eight pence a day.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Customers on social tariffs will continue to be exempt from any price changes, O2 said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Ofcom has now written to the major mobile companies reminding them of their obligations to treat customers fairly.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The regulator also told customers that a provider must give 30 days&#x27; notice and let them exit a contract penalty-free if they raise prices beyond what was agreed when first signing up. That means customers are free to take a new deal – either with the existing provider or a new one.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We encourage any customer who wants to avoid these price rises to exercise their right to exit without penalty and sign up to a new deal,&quot; the spokesperson told us.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Ofcom&#x27;s other tips include shopping around via price comparison sites and using its

<title> NHS left with sick PCs as suppliers resist Windows 11 treatment </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/nhs_windows_11_issues/</link>

&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   NHS hospitals are being blocked from fully upgrading to Windows 11 by a small number of suppliers that have yet to make their medical devices compatible with Microsoft&#x27;s latest operating system.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Digital Health News
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalhealth.net/2025/10/medical-device-suppliers-stalling-nhs-upgrade-to-windows-11/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    reported
   &lt;/a&gt;
   this week that one supplier quoted the Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust £25,000 to upgrade a three-year-old device so it would work with Windows 11, which rolled out in 2021.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   James Rawlinson, the trust&#x27;s director of health informatics, said that while 98 percent of its Microsoft estate has already been upgraded, around 2 percent of devices remain on older software because suppliers have not yet updated their systems to support Windows 11.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We have some examples where we bought clinical and medical equipment and the manufacturer now says we have to buy it brand new even though it&#x27;s only three years old,&quot; Rawlinson said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft officially
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/16/windows_10_office_and_servers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    ended support for Windows 10
   &lt;/a&gt;
   on October 14, meaning any devices still running the operating system will no longer receive critical security patches – including those used in medical settings.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While Redmond offers
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/windows_11_market_share/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    a paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) program

    the directive from NHS England
   &lt;/a&gt;
   is to upgrade to Windows 11 to protect patient data and keep clinical systems secure.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Rawlinson said the trust had quarantined outdated devices to minimize cyber risk while it attempted to negotiate solutions with suppliers, calling the issue &quot;worrisome.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In addition to the cybersecurity risks posed, Rawlinson noted that taking outdated systems offline could also impact care – for example, by preventing pacemakers from communicating with cardiology systems. &quot;You just hope and pray that nothing untoward happens,&quot; he said.

<title> Europe preps Digital Euro to enter circulation in 2029 </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/digital_euro_approved/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 05:26:20 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided the bloc needs a digital version of the Euro, and ordered work that could see it enter circulation in 2029.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Europe initiated a “preparation phase” for a Digital Euro in November 2023. Yesterday, the ECB said that effort succeeded. ECB President Christine Lagarde said developing a Digital Euro will make the currency “fit for the future.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Asked why the European Union needs a Digital Euro, and if it is a solution in search of a problem, Lagarde said “The key points for me are : Money is a public good; central banks are the custodian of that public good; and central money issued by central banks has to have its digital form, because we&#x27;re moving into a different era where not everybody will want necessarily to have banknotes.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Two thirds of digital payments in the Euro area are intermediated by non-European companies
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A digital currency would also reduce the European Union’s reliance on payment service providers from outside the bloc.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Fabio Panetta, Governor of the Bank of Italy, pointed out that European banks represent only a third of digital payments activities within the Eurozone, and that “Two thirds of digital payments in the Euro area are intermediated by non-European companies, both for digital payments at the point of sale and digital payments online.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “The reason why this is so is that European banks did not agree until now on ways to provide their services to the entire Euro area,” he said. “They don&#x27;t have what is called in technical terms a ‘rail’, the infrastructure to provide, to offer their digital payment services to all European citizens.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Panetta therefore thinks that a Digital Euro would mean European banks can compete across the continent.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   “One of the main benefits for the banks in the Euro area is that once the digital euro infrastructure will be built, they will be able, by using this so-called open standard infrastructure, to use that rail and compete at a European level, thus generating additional business, additional revenues, and there will be many implications in terms of sovereignty for the euro area, in terms of control of the information that travels with your payments.”
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Lagarde said the ECB’s plan is to conduct a pilot of the Digital Euro by 2027 with a view to possible public use in 2029.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;

     China warns of fake digital currency wallets fleecing netizens
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/21/programmable_money/&quot;&gt;
     Programmable or &#x27;purpose-bound&#x27; money is coming, probably as a feature in central bank digital currencies
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Digital Euro would be a “central bank digital currency” (CBDC), a concept that has been explored around the world but attracted critics who worry they could erode privacy or restrict freedoms.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Privacy advocates argue that every digital transaction creates records, so it could be possible to track a consumer’s use of a CBDC. Freedom-loving folk worry that CBDCs could be programmed so that some consumers could not use them on certain goods or services – think welfare recipients not being able to buy alcohol.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Security is another concern, because there’s no point in encouraging the public to adopt digital wallets if they’re easier to rob than physical wallets.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The ECB estimates it will cost €1.3 billion to get a Digital Euro into circulation, and that operating costs would then be around €320 million per year. ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

<title> Major telecom supplier compromised by unnamed nation-state attackers </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/major_telco_networking_provider_compromised/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 03:24:35 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Nation-state snoops broke into Ribbon Communications – an outfit that provides software and networking gear to Verizon, CenturyLink, and the US Defense Department – last December, remained hidden for about nine months, and stole files belonging to three customers, according to the US telecommunications firm.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Ribbon prides itself on our long-standing partnerships with our customers and we know that security is a paramount concern within their networks,&quot; a spokesperson told
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   . &quot;While we do not have evidence at this time that would indicate the threat actor gained access to any material information, we continue to work with our third-party experts to confirm this.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;h3&gt;
    Security nightmare stories needed!
   &lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Boss get the company hacked because he taped passwords to his monitor? Coworker get phished by a Nigerian prince?
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Share the dirty details and they might appear in a future edition of PWNED, our new weekly feature about the worst security breaches that never should have happened.
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Drop us a line at
    &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:pwned@sitpub.com&quot;&gt;
     pwned@sitpub.com
    &lt;/a&gt;
    . Your anonymity is guaranteed.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Ribbon has also taken steps to improve its network security and prevent future intrusions, we&#x27;re told.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The firm&#x27;s breach confirmation to
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   follows an October 23 US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing in which Ribbon said it uncovered the digital intrusion in early September.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;The Company became aware that unauthorized persons, reportedly associated with a nation-state actor, had gained access to the Company&#x27;s IT network,&quot; according to Ribbon’s
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001708055/000170805525000035/rbbn-20250930x10q.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    quarterly report
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The filing doesn&#x27;t identify the attacker and the company’s spokesperson declined to say who was responsible for the intrusion, &quot;in keeping with the request of the federal agency assisting Ribbon.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Several customer files saved outside of the main network on two laptops do appear to have been accessed by the threat actor and those customers have been notified by the Company,&quot; according to the SEC filing.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The company spokesperson confirmed the incident impacted three &quot;smaller customers&quot; but declined to name them or identify the sectors in which they operate. &quot;A total of four older files were accessed&quot; is all we’ve been told.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Ribbon also told the SEC that &quot;multiple&quot; third-party cybersecurity experts and federal law enforcement are assisting with the ongoing clean-up efforts. &quot;While the investigation is ongoing, the Company believes that it has been successful in terminating the unauthorized access by the threat actor,&quot; it said.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) spokesperson Marci McCarthy confirmed to
   &lt;i&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/i&gt;
   that &quot;CISA is aware of Ribbon Communications&#x27; disclosure today involving an incident with the company&#x27;s IT network,&quot; and directed any questions about the incident and response to the company.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Ribbon provides communications software and IP Optical networking gear to major service providers including BT, Verizon, Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink), Deutsche Telekom, SoftBank, TalkTalk, and Tata, along with government agencies such as the US Department of Defense, and local governments including the City of Los Angeles, California.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This makes it a high-value target for government-backed snoops looking to attack a carrier network and then use that access to break into its customers&#x27; environments. And, at least with the limited amount of detail we have about the intrusion, it sounds similar to recent
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/22/salt_typhoon_sharepoint_attacks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Salt Typhoon intrusions
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/06/charter_consolidated_windstream_salt_typhoon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    hacked America&#x27;s major telecommunications firms
   &lt;/a&gt;
   and

   &lt;/a&gt;
   , then
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/09/white_house_salt_typhoon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    stole information
   &lt;/a&gt;
   belonging to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/28/fbi_cyber_cop_salt_typhoon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    nearly every American
   &lt;/a&gt;
   . The Salt Typhoon hacks began around 2019, but US authorities did not
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/14/salt_typhoon_hacked_multiple_telecom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    uncover
   &lt;/a&gt;
   them until late 2024.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   At the time, T-Mobile&#x27;s US security boss told
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   that the Salt Typhoon cyber-spies hopped between organizations&#x27; networks in a way he&#x27;d never seen before.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;The technique that was used to go from one telecommunications infrastructure to another, I would say, is novel,&quot; T-Mo Chief Security Officer Jeff Simon
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/05/tmobile_cso_telecom_attack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    told us
   &lt;/a&gt;
   late last year. &quot;That&#x27;s not something that I&#x27;ve seen in my 15-plus-year career in cybersecurity. It&#x27;s not something that is well published or read about. There&#x27;s no CVE for it.&quot; ®
  &lt;/p&gt;

<title> Microsoft Azure challenges AWS for downtime crown </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/microsoft_azure_outage/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 02:08:11 -0000</pubDate>

&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft Azure has been experiencing a global outage since around 1600 UTC, or 0900 PDT on Wednesday, October 29, 2025.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The company expects that services will be fully restored by 23:20 UTC, or about 16:20 PDT this afternoon.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The outage is occurring somewhat inconveniently as Microsoft reports its

<title> Claude code will send your data to crims ... if they ask it nicely </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/anthropics_claude_private_data/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 21:07:31 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   A researcher has found a way to trick Claude into uploading private data to an attacker&#x27;s account using indirect prompt injection. Anthropic says it has already documented the risk, and its foolproof solution is: keep an eye on your screen.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Security researcher Johann Rehberger (wunderwuzzi), who has identified
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://embracethered.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    dozens
   &lt;/a&gt;
   of AI-oriented vulnerabilities, has published a summary of a proof-of-concept attack he developed for stealing private data via Claude.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   When asked about the exploit, Anthropic posited that its existing documentation adequately warns users about the possibility of data exfiltration when they enable network connectivity. The company&#x27;s
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude#h_27fc9da35e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    recommended mitigation
   &lt;/a&gt;
   for network access risks is to &quot;monitor Claude while using the feature and stop it if you see it using or accessing data unexpectedly.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;The exploit hijacks Claude and follows the adversaries instructions to grab private data, write it to the sandbox, and then calls the Anthropic File API to upload the file to the attacker&#x27;s account using the attacker&#x27;s API key,&quot; Rehberger wrote in his
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/claude-abusing-network-access-and-anthropic-api-for-data-exfiltration/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    explanatory post
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The use of the term &quot;sandbox&quot; suggests more security than the word actually affords in the context of AI tools. Last month, Claude gained the ability
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    to create and edit files
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , and also gained access to &quot;a private computer environment where it can write code and run programs.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   That capability, similar to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/analysis-tool&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    a prior JavaScript analysis feature
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , comes with the option to enable network access. And when you do so, your private sandbox is potentially exposed to the public internet.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Anthropic provides network egress settings to limit the potential risk, though as Rehberger&#x27;s attack demonstrates, any network access setting is a problem.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Network access is enabled by default for Pro and Max accounts; for Team plans, it&#x27;s off by default but becomes active for everyone once administratively enabled; and for Enterprise plans, it&#x27;s off by default and is subject to organizational network access controls.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   When network access is enabled, the default scope is to provide access only to package managers (e.g. npm, PyPI, GitHub). More permissive settings provide for allow-listed domains or for full network access.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   But as Rehberger observed, even the most restrictive network setting (package managers only) comes with the ability to access Anthropic APIs. And he realized he could use this API with his own API key in place of the victim&#x27;s to exfiltrate data from the victim&#x27;s Anthropic account.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The attack starts with a document that contains malicious instructions. In order for the attack to work, the victim needs to ask Claude to summarize the document. Claude, like other AI models, may then execute the attack prompt that has been injected into the document content, because
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/ai_browsers_prompt_injection/&quot;&gt;
    that&#x27;s how prompt injection works
   &lt;/a&gt;
   – models can&#x27;t separate content from directives.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Rehberger has chosen not to release his specific injected prompt but says that it&#x27;s not straightforward. Claude rejected his initial attempts – the model didn&#x27;t want to ingest the attacker API key in clear text.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   But Rehberger found a way to get Claude to cooperate by mixing in a lot of harmless code, like
   &lt;code&gt;
    print(&#x27;Hello, world&#x27;)
   &lt;/code&gt;
   , into his prompt, to convince the model that nothing was amiss. He has published
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IoqhwqVI0s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    a video on YouTube
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that demonstrates the attack.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Rehberger disclosed the indirect prompt injection vulnerability to Anthropic through HackerOne and says that his report was closed for being out of scope.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;This report was incorrectly closed as out of scope due to a process error,&quot; an Anthropic spokesperson told
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   in an email. &quot;Data exfiltration issues are valid reports under our program. However, we had already identified and publicly
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude#h_6b7e833898&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    documented this specific risk
   &lt;/a&gt;
   in our security documentation before the report was submitted.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   We inquired whether the company might consider implementing a check to detect when one Anthropic account uses an API key tied to a different Anthropic account, but we&#x27;ve not heard back.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Anthropic appears to be satisfied that its security guidance adequately informs customers about the potential risks of giving AI models access to networks and tools. The biz explicitly warns against this possibility in the
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12111783-create-and-edit-files-with-claude#h_27fc9da35e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    security considerations
   &lt;/a&gt;
   section of its documentation about file creation and network access.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The AI outfit explains, &quot;It is possible for a bad actor to inconspicuously add instructions via external files or websites that trick Claude into: 1) Downloading and running untrusted code in the sandbox environment for malicious purposes; 2) Reading sensitive data from a connected knowledge source (for example, Remote MCP, projects) and using the sandbox environment to make an external network request to leak the data.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Prompt injection and other forms of abuse are possible not just for Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, but for pretty much any AI model given access to a network, either via integration with a web browser or when computer usage is implemented –
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    as in Claude Sonnet 4.5
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   hCaptcha Threat Analysis Group recently evaluated OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Atlas, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Computer Use, Google&#x27;s Gemini Computer Use, Manus AI, and Perplexity Comet to see how well they resist nefarious meddling. The biz
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hcaptcha.com/post/report-browser-agent-safety-is-an-afterthought-for-vendors&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    found
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , &quot;Across the board, these products attempted nearly every malicious request with no jailbreaking required, generally failing only due to tooling limitations rather than any safeguards.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   hCaptcha reports seeing a few refusals, but says those could be overcome by rephrasing the request or other basic jailbreaking techniques.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;It is hard to see how these products can be operated in their current state without causing liability for their creators,&quot; the security firm mused. &quot;Every request comes back to the company server in most tools, and yet abuse controls are nearly absent.&quot; ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

<title> Microsoft 365 business customers are running out of places to hide from Copilot </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/microsoft_365_companion_apps/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 19:28:31 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Just when you thought Microsoft had run out of Windows apps to stuff with Copilot, it&#x27;s cramming the AI into your taskbar companions - People, Files, and Calendar are next.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The Microsoft 365 companion
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-microsoft-365-companions-a27df74a-cc41-4e74-8216-51091dc30194&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    apps
   &lt;/a&gt;
   - lightweight, always-on taskbar tools for browsing your People, Files, and Calendar data - are the latest to get the Copilot treatment,
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365insiderblog/work-smarter-with-copilot-in-the-people-files-and-calendar-apps/4462091&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;
    says
   &lt;/a&gt;
   Redmond.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft in August said it would begin automatically installing the companion apps on Windows 11 devices with Microsoft 365 subscriptions in late October as part of the regular Microsoft 365 Apps update process. They&#x27;re available only to commercial tenants - Enterprise and Business customers - so don&#x27;t expect to find them on a personal Microsoft 365 setup.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The latest update injects Copilot into the mix, letting the AI draw on your organization&#x27;s people, files, and meetings to offer context-aware prompts and summaries.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;With Copilot, each companion app will be grounded in your work data - people, files, meetings - making them the fastest and easiest way to prompt for relevant questions,&quot; Microsoft 365 companion apps team principal product manager Yash Kamalanath said in the company&#x27;s announcement.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The People app, for example, &quot;surfaces recent communications, highlights key responsibilities, and suggests tailored prompts to help you connect and collaborate,&quot; because nothing says genuine interaction like AI-generated fluff.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Files will allow users to loop Copilot into work documents to get a summary, highlight recent changes, pick apart data, and &quot;create action items without breaking your flow.&quot; The Copilot Calendar companion app integration, meanwhile, will let users get meeting summaries and suggestions on what material to prep for an upcoming discussion.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Both People and Files Copilot features are live now, with the Calendar integration coming soon, Microsoft said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

     Clippy rises from the dead in major update to Copilot and its voice interface
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/16/microsoft_copilot_updates/&quot;&gt;
     Feeling lonely? Microsoft Copilot can now listen to your every word, watch your screen
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/copilot_viva_insights_column/&quot;&gt;
     The real insight behind measuring Copilot usage is Microsoft&#x27;s desperation
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/24/bbc_probe_ai_news/&quot;&gt;
     BBC probe finds AI chatbots mangle nearly half of news summaries
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The addition of Copilot to the Microsoft 365 companion apps is the latest in a line of Redmond sticking AI into every crevice of the company&#x27;s software lineup that it can find. Other recent examples include Copilot showing up
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/microsoft_adds_copilot_ai_formulas/&quot;&gt;
    directly in Excel cells
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , and possibly soon to on-prem Exchange Server installations if Microsoft&#x27;s
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/23/copilot_exchange_server/&quot;&gt;
    exploration
   &lt;/a&gt;
   of the idea pans out.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The company&#x27;s Copilot endeavors haven&#x27;t always
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/18/microsoft_copilot_not_wanted/&quot;&gt;
    been welcomed
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , we note, especially when it adds tools that allow managers to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/microsoft_copilot_viva_insights/&quot;&gt;
    monitor Copilot usage
   &lt;/a&gt;
   among various teams to push more usage of its flagship AI product.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Administrators can manage whether the Microsoft 365 companion apps are deployed in their environments, according to Microsoft&#x27;s documentation, but there&#x27;s no separate switch to strip Copilot out of the trio once they&#x27;re installed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft didn&#x27;t respond to questions for this story. ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title> Google parent company spending like a drunken sailor as capex triples over 2 years </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/alphabet_capex/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 19:04:48 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Alphabet, Google&#x27;s parent company, expects capital expenditures to hit $93 billion in 2025, largely to meet demand from cloud customers, according to its recent financial report.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   On the back of results that revealed revenue for the third quarter was $102.34 billion, representing 16 percent year-on-year growth, Alphabet signaled a headlong charge into datacenter building to meet demand for AI services well into next year. Capex was
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204424000014/googexhibit991q42023.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    $32.25 billion in 2023
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , and the estimate for 2025
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/30/alphabet-googl-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    stood at $75 billion in February
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet senior veep and CFO, told investors: &quot;We&#x27;re continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we&#x27;re experiencing from cloud customers as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company. We now expect capex to be in the range of $91 billion to $93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion... Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in capex.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Not to be outdone, Microsoft is also ramping up capex in the face of the AI boom and expects it to accelerate through its financial year. The figure for the first quarter of its financial year 2026 stands at $34.9 billion, according to recent results, larger than investment analysts had expected, and up from $24 billion in the previous quarter.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Amy Hood, executive veep and CFO, told investors this was largely driven by growing demand for the company&#x27;s cloud and AI offerings. About half the spending was on &quot;short-lived assets&quot; such as GPUs and CPUs to support increasing Azure platform demand and first-party AI solutions, for example.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We&#x27;re increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the financial year 2026 growth rate to be higher than financial year 2025,&quot; she said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Microsoft&#x27;s capital expenditure in the quarter stood at $34.9 billion, compared with Visible Alpha estimates of $30.34 billion.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   However, investors were less than impressed. Shares of the company dropped by 3 percent in extended trading last night as the growth in capex worried investors who are are becoming increasingly concerned about an AI bubble, according to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/microsofts-cloud-surge-lifts-revenue-above-expectations-2025-10-29/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    reports
   &lt;/a&gt;
   .
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Oracle is also planning a massive datacenter expansion to meet the demand it expects for AI and has increased its borrowing to fund the spree. It has already
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/oracle_18_billion_debt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    launched an $18 billion bond sale

    reports suggest
   &lt;/a&gt;
   it plans another $38 billion debt offering. Estimates suggest it will need to borrow
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/29/oracle_ai_debt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    $100 billion over four years
   &lt;/a&gt;
   to fulfill the demand of its $300 billion cloud compute contract with OpenAI.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    Other reports
   &lt;/a&gt;
   suggest investors were concerned about the speed at which AI datacenter spending could offer revenue and that the rush to capture market share might see the big players overshoot demand. ®

 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The State of Colorado has thrown a sueball at the Trump administration over the president&#x27;s decision to relocate the headquarters of the US Space Command from Colorado Springs to Alabama.

   Trump
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/03/trump_announces_move_of_space/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    announced
   &lt;/a&gt;
   the relocation in September. Colorado had been selected by the previous Biden administration, which US Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama decried as &quot;political cronyism.&quot; Tuberville later told Trump that the headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama, would be named the &quot;Donald J. Trump Space Command Center.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   According to Trump, a &quot;big factor&quot; in the decision was Colorado&#x27;s support for mail-in voting. &quot;So they have automatically crooked elections,&quot; he said, &quot;and we can&#x27;t have that...&quot; Despite Trump&#x27;s rhetoric, there is

    no credible evidence
   &lt;/a&gt;
   associating mail-in voting with an increased incidence of voting fraud.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   At the time, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said of the move, &quot;I&#x27;m prepared to challenge it in court,&quot; and so here we are.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    said
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , &quot;The president&#x27;s decision to punish Colorado by relocating Space Command because of the lawful exercise of our authority to regulate elections – and his threats of further harmful action – violate the Tenth Amendment.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;

   The
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/10/30/coloradocomplaint.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    lawsuit
   &lt;/a&gt;
   [PDF] directed at Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Air Force Secretary Troy Meink, argues that Colorado is entitled to regulate elections itself rather than at the direction of the President, hence the complaint about mail-in voting should not have a bearing on the decision.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Furthermore, &quot;the Executive Branch also violated statutory requirements mandating detailed processes and public disclosures through the submission of reports to Congress before taking action to relocate a major military headquarters.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In other words, due process was not followed in the relocation decision.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The complaint states that &quot;President Trump has unlawfully retaliated against Colorado to punish the State for its exercise of sovereign authority to regulate elections.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   According to Trump, the move will result in more than 30,000 jobs for Alabama and investments totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. At the time of the decision to keep the headquarters of Space Command in Colorado Springs, the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://denverchamber.org/space-command-headquarters-will-remain-in-colorado-springs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    stated
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that 1,400 Colorado jobs depended on the HQ&#x27;s location, and the annual economic impact was $1 billion.

<title> Firewalls and VPNs are so complex now, they can actually make you less secure </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/cisco_citrix_vpn_ransomware/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:07:56 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Organizations using Cisco and Citrix VPN devices were nearly seven times as likely to suffer a ransomware infection over a 15-month period, according to At-Bay, a provider of cyber insurance and a vendor of managed detection and response products.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;When compared to businesses without a VPN detected, organizations using Cisco or Citrix were 6.8X more likely to fall victim to an attack,&quot; according to At-Bay’s 2025 InsurSec Report [
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/10/28/at_bay_2025_insursec_report.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    PDF
   &lt;/a&gt;
   ], which notes that Cisco and Citrix held the top spots in last year&#x27;s report, too.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    We&#x27;re not suggesting these products are inherently insecure, but they are complex
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   These numbers reflect ransomware insurance claims made between January 2024 and March 2025, and the report&#x27;s overall findings come from At-Bay&#x27;s analysis of &quot;more than 100,000 policy years of cyber claims data.&quot; While it doesn&#x27;t say how many organizations this includes, the company has about 40,000 customers in the US.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Neither Cisco nor Citrix responded to
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   &#x27;s requests for comment.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   When asked if these findings mean that Cisco and Citrix VPN users should find another vendor, At-Bay CISO for Customers Adam Tyra told
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   , &quot;We think the takeaway is clear: Companies relying on on-premise VPN devices from vendors like Cisco and Citrix should strongly consider transitioning to modern cloud-based, remote access solutions.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   For comparison: SonicWall VPN users clocked in No. 2, at 5.8 times more likely to fall victim to ransomware, Palo Alto Global Protect VPN users were 5.5X, followed by Fortinet at 5.3X. &quot;Additionally, businesses using an on-premise VPN of any kind were 3.7X more likely to fall victim to an attack than those using a cloud-based VPN or no VPN detected,&quot; according to the report.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   These risk numbers are not simply a reflection of how common these devices are in At-Bay&#x27;s customers&#x27; environments, according to Tyra. &quot;Our analysis adjusted for that,&quot; he said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We&#x27;re not suggesting these products are inherently insecure, but they are complex and require consistent maintenance,&quot; Tyra said, referring to on-prem VPN appliances. &quot;While many organizations can deploy them securely, far fewer can maintain them properly over time, leading to missed patches and outdated configurations.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The report notes that a whopping 80 percent of ransomware attacks against companies insured by At-Bay last year started with attackers using a remote access tool to gain access, and 83 percent of those cases involved a VPN device.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   At-Bay cites a couple reasons for this: VPN appliances give attackers a &quot;door into networks that would otherwise be inaccessible.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Second, they are really complex – illustrating how most orgs will choose simplicity over security any day of the week.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;Early VPNs were simple,&quot; the report says. &quot;They only handled VPN connections and were easier to secure. Over time, vendors began combining multiple functions (like firewall, router, proxy, and VPN) into a single device.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This led to next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), which exploded in popularity following the pandemic-induced remote work rush of 2020. &quot;The result is that NGFWs create a very large attack surface, which attackers are actively taking advantage of,&quot; the report authors wrote.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;The bottom line is that traditional on-premise VPNs are often too difficult for most companies to operate securely,&quot; Tyra said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Tyra added that cloud-based Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) products &quot;significantly reduce exposure to direct attacks compared to traditional VPNs.&quot; And for those that must use on-premises systems, &quot;it&#x27;s critical to invest in continuous maintenance, configuration management, and timely patching to minimize risk,&quot; he said.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
   Don&#x27;t forget SonicWall
  &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While intrusions – and subsequent insurance claims – affecting SonicWall devices didn&#x27;t happen in the January 2024 through first-quarter 2025 time frame, the firewall and VPN provider got a call-out in the 2025 report thanks to a 300 percent increase in Akira ransomware attacks that At-Bay&#x27;s incident responders saw during the third quarter of this year, compared to Q2. The average ransomware demand also jumped 104 percent, to $958,000.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Almost all of these cases involved compromised SonicWall devices. &quot;While the exact cause remains unclear, weak credentials, lack of automatic updates, and poor MFA/EDR coverage appear to be key factors,&quot; according to the report.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   SonicWall didn&#x27;t respond to
   &lt;em&gt;
    The Register
   &lt;/em&gt;
   &#x27;s request for comment.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   As a reminder: During Q3
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/10/akira_ransomware_abusing_sonicwall/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Akira ransomware affiliates
   &lt;/a&gt;
   were caught exploiting a
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/04/sonicwall_investigates_cyber_incidents/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    critical SonicWall vulnerability
   &lt;/a&gt;
   that they abused last summer, and poked holes in SonicWall SSLVPN misconfigurations to gain access to vulnerable devices and conduct ransomware attacks.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The attacks were tied to
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-40766&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    CVE-2024-40766
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , a CVSS 9.8-rated improper access control flaw originally disclosed in August 2024. Both

   &lt;/a&gt;
   and Fog ransomware criminals used this CVE last year to gain initial access to victim orgs, and in August 2025 SonicWall said not all companies took the needed steps to mitigate the issue.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;The sheer volume of security issues related to SonicWall devices over the last few years makes it difficult to identify what, specifically, Akira is relying on to mount these attacks,&quot; Tyra said.
  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We have at least six different credible hypotheses to explain Akira&#x27;s activities, but none of them can explain all of the attacks we&#x27;ve seen,&quot; Tyra continued. &quot;Besides the high number of exploitable vulnerabilities discovered on these devices, SonicWall itself recently reported a breach of their system storing backup copies of configuration data for their products, and that may be a factor as well.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   He&#x27;s referring to an October admission by the vendor that
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/sonicwall_breach_hits_every_cloud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    all customers
   &lt;/a&gt;
   who used SonicWall&#x27;s cloud backup service to store firewall configuration files were affected by a cybersecurity incident first disclosed in mid-September. The company previously said less than five percent of its customers were impacted.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;We don&#x27;t have evidence linking SonicWall directly to these attacks,&quot; Tyra noted. &quot;That said, this situation underscores the importance of ongoing vendor evaluation and proactive security maintenance, regardless of which products an organization uses.” ®

<title> Docker Compose vulnerability opens door to host-level writes – patch pronto </title>
<link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/30/docker_compose_desktop_flaws/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 16:39:37 -0000</pubDate>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Docker Compose users are being strongly urged to upgrade their versions of the orchestration tool after a researcher uncovered a flaw that could allow attackers to stage path traversal attacks.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   NIST has dubbed the Compose vulnerability
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62725&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    CVE-2025-62725
   &lt;/a&gt;
   and given it a 8.9 severity rating.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   The bug was uncovered by Imperva&#x27;s Ron Masas in early October. As
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperva.com/blog/cve-2025-62725-from-docker-compose-ps-to-system-compromise/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Masas writes
   &lt;/a&gt;
   , Compose is a &quot;friendly layer above Docker Engine that turns a few YAML lines into a running application.&quot; Unsurprisingly then, it powers millions of workflows, &quot;from CI/CD runners and local development stacks to cloud workspaces and enterprise build pipelines.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   He uncovered the high-severity path traversal vulnerability while exploring the tool&#x27;s recently added support for OCI-based Compose artifacts. &quot;The flaw allowed attackers to escape Compose&#x27;s cache directory and write arbitrary files on the host system, simply by tricking a user into referencing a malicious remote artifact.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   &quot;When Compose processed OCI layers it trusted the layer annotations that tell it where to write files,&quot; he said. So an attacker could craft an annotation, and Compose &quot;performed a literal join between its local cache directory and that annotation… No normalization, no canonicalization, no checks that the resulting path stayed inside the cache.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   That in turn would allow the crafted annotation to traverse out of the cache directory, &quot;and cause Compose to write files anywhere the Compose process had permission to write.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   While Docker Compose&#x27;s OCI artifact feature aims to streamline configuration sharing, this incident illustrates how automatic file reconstruction from unverified sources can obscure important security boundaries.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Masas said the Docker team&#x27;s quick response and fix ensured users remain protected, but the incident drove home the point to &quot;sanitize every path, even when &#x27;it&#x27;s just YAML.&#x27;&quot; In the meantime, Imperva recommended users upgrade to v2.40.2.
  &lt;/p&gt;

     Docker Desktop bug let containers hop the fence with barely a nudge
    &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   In other news, Docker has fixed a flaw in its Windows Installer that left it vulnerable to DLL injection. The Desktop Installer.exe flaw was dubbed
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/vulnerability/EUVD-2025-36191&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    EUVD-2025-36191
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by ENISA earlier this week, with a 8.8 rating.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   ENISA said the flaw means Desktop Installer.exe &quot;is vulnerable to DLL hijacking due to insecure DLL search order. The installer searches for required DLLs in the user&#x27;s Downloads folder before checking system directories.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This weakness allowed attackers to gain higher-level access to the system by placing malicious DLL files in specific locations.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   Docker plugged the gap in Desktop 4.49.0, released last week, meaning users should upgrade if they haven&#x27;t already. Release notes for the latest version also warned that the next release onward will require at least Windows 10 22H2 or Windows 11 23H2.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
   This is the second month on the trot Docker has had to plug a high-severity flaw in Desktop, while in August, it had to plug a critical flaw. However, many vendors or projects happily clock up tens, hundreds, or even thousands of flaws a year. OWASP&#x27;s
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Docker_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    first rule
   &lt;/a&gt;
   for Docker security is &quot;Keep Host and Docker up to date.&quot; ®
  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
